/**
 * Stage 9 — the road from the recorded decision to an issued Passport, in
 * order, with the previous stage's outcome PULLED THROUGH.
 *
 * ── The defects this replaces ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Stage 9 was three disconnected panels. Nothing on it said the case had
 * been CLEARED at Stage 8 — the reader saw "Under review — not yet
 * decided" about the gate and read it as the decision not pulling
 * through. Nothing ordered gate → preview → issue, so how the Aurixa
 * Passport actually gets issued was a hunt. And the stage's primary
 * button carried no actionType, so it fell to the workspace switch's
 * default — a scroll to a screening anchor that does not exist here —
 * the same broken-button class as Stages 6, 7 and 8 before it.
 *
 * ── What this module is ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Arrangement only. The decision comes from the case row, the gate from
 * the gate column, the credential state from the SERVER-derived passport
 * projection (this module never derives a passport state of its own —
 * that is the one rule the passport facts carry). Issuance stays where it
 * belongs: the MLRO controls in the reliance panel; preview is the
 * digital passport page, exactly as the client and partners will see it.
