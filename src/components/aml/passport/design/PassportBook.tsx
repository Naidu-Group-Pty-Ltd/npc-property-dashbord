/**
 * The passport as a bound document — the shared viewer.
 *
 * ONE implementation, used by the Command Centre dialog and by the Client
 * Portal page. That is deliberate: the client and the officer must be looking
 * at the same artefact, and two renderers of "the passport" would eventually
 * disagree about what it looks like. Audience differences are already handled
 * upstream by the projection, so nothing here needs to know who is reading.
 *
 * ## Why the leaf is scaled rather than laid out fluidly
 *
 * Every type size, rule, seal and grid inside a leaf is authored against a
 * 470×648 box. Letting flexbox squeeze that box — which is what the previous
 * version did — keeps 11px body copy and 30px seals inside a 200px-wide page,
 * so text reflows, wraps one character per line and overflows. Rendering the
 * leaf at its design size and applying a uniform `transform: scale()` keeps
 * every internal proportion exactly as designed, at any viewport. The
 * arithmetic lives in `bookletGeometry` so it is testable without a DOM.

/**
 * A miniature of the real cover.
 *
 * It renders `BookletCover` itself, at design size, under the same uniform
 * transform the book uses for a leaf — it is NOT a second, simplified drawing
 * of the cover. That matters for the same reason the client and the officer
 * share one viewer: a hand-drawn "thumbnail version" is a copy, and a copy
 * drifts. Change the cover once — the emblem, the frame rules, the gold, the
 * type — and every surface that shows one follows, including this.
 *
 * Because it is the real artwork built from the real projection, it is
 * per-customer by construction. Nothing here is specialised to a case; pass a
 * different `view` and you get that customer's bearer, credential and state.
 *
 * ## Why nothing here measures anything
 *
 * The cover is a fixed 470×648 composition, so a miniature is a slot width and
 * a scale factor — and those two are the SAME number. Deriving them separately
 * is how a miniature ends up clipped: a first draft took the width from CSS
 * (112px on a phone) and the scale from JS, and any moment the two disagreed —
 * before the first layout effect, in a server render, on a hidden tab — the
 * board was drawn at one size inside a box of another and lost its clasp to
 * `overflow: hidden`.
 *
 * So the size is declared ONCE, as the unitless `--passport-thumb-w`, and the
 * stylesheet derives both the box (`calc(var(--passport-thumb-w) * 1px)`) and
 * the scale (`calc(var(--passport-thumb-w) / 470)`) from it. They cannot
 * disagree, there is no JS in the path at all, and a surface resizes the cover
 * by setting one custom property.
