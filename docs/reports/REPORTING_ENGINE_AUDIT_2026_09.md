# Reporting Engine audit — September 2026

A full end-to-end audit of the reporting engine, conducted stage by stage with the
product owner: architecture → data injection → generation pathways → template
selection and white-label → practical rendering. This file is the durable record
of what was measured and found. **No behavioural change ships with this
document** — every fix is listed for the consolidation programme, and anything
that hides or retires a legacy pathway explicitly awaits the owner's
authorisation.

Method: the docs in `docs/reports/` were read first and then re-verified against
the code and against the **live production database** (read-only). Rendering
claims were verified by rendering: the pinned engine (WeasyPrint 69.0) with the
container's own typefaces, the repo's measurement tooling, real production rows
through the real projections and templates, and a page-by-page review of the
result. Every load-bearing number below is a fresh measurement dated
2026-09-02, not a quotation of an earlier doc.

## 1 · Architecture census

Two layers, separate in code and time:

**Generation** (content): `generate-investment-report` writes model-authored
Markdown into `investment_reports.report_content` under a wall-clock budget with
three resume drivers (browser pump, bulk worker, 2-minute cron watchdog). Other
formats are deterministic calculators plus bounded model prose. Sub-reports
derive from a Compass parent: **fork** (`fork-investment-report` — deterministic
section split via `_shared/reportSplitRegistry.ts`, no model calls, idempotent,
inherits the parent's data wholesale) and **condense**
(`condense-investment-report` — model-condensed briefing/snapshot, regenerates
in place).

**Rendering** (documents): five engines exist in live code.

| # | Engine | Carries |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | WeasyPrint via nine per-format design-system routes (`render-*-pdf`) | the migrated formats' standard documents |
| 2 | WeasyPrint via `render-template-pdf` (browser compiles HTML through `compileTemplateHtmlForPdf`) | chosen-template documents |
| 3 | WeasyPrint via `render-investment-report-pdf` — 5.7k-line monolith, own inline THEME, own private client, Api2PDF fallback | nearly all Investment volume |
| 4 | pdf-lib in Deno ×2 (`quantitative-report-pipeline`, legacy export inside `report-qa`) | quantitative reports; legacy Q&A export |
| 5 | ~17 live browser generators (jsPDF / html2canvas / pdf-lib) | the legacy side of most formats; record nothing |

Storage: `investment-reports` (two producers), `client-files` (six routes),
`marketing-reports`, `qa_exports`, `quantitative-reports`, `converted-templates`;
all report PDFs served by signed URL (TTLs vary: 7d legacy / 24h routes / 15-min
`secure-storage` ceiling). Ledgers: nine `*_renders` tables +
`template_render_jobs` + `template_events`.

Two unrelated systems share the word "template": `report_templates`
(presentation / white-label) and `report_structure_templates` (generation-time
structure guides). They never touch.

## 2 · Live measurements (2026-09-02)

- Coverage (per `COVERAGE.md`'s own query): investment **1,174 / 0** via design
  system; report_qa 255/2; portfolio 26/2; market_intelligence 7/0.
  **The coverage query cannot see the templated path** — it counts `*_renders`
  ledgers, while template renders land in `template_render_jobs` (127 rows, 114
  succeeded, successes for `investment_compass` and `commercial_capacity` on the
  audit date). `investment_report_renders` has **no writer anywhere in the
  codebase**, so that cell can never move.
- Templates: 10 active global WeasyPrint masters (one per format spelling,
  "Private Banking — Chancery") + 4 active user-scoped adoptions; 96 legacy
  jspdf rows deactivated. 4 stored selections, all valid.
- Downloads, last 45 days: `premium_weasyprint` 24 (legacy investment route),
  `cash_flow_server` 11, `cash_flow_template` 7, `report_viewer` 6 (browser),
  `pixel_perfect_generator` 1.
- `investment_reports`: 1,174 completed / 18 failed / 1 stale pending (the
  resume watchdog works). 17 new reports in 30 days.
- Sub-reports in production: snapshot 25, briefing 22, financial 10,
  strategic 10 — all four active on the audit date.

## 3 · Findings register

Class key: **D** data/content · **P** pathway/delivery · **T** template/white-label · **R** rendering.

| # | Class | Finding | Evidence / location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | D | `financial_calculations` injection unreliable: 190/1,174 rows overall; 71% of Compass rows since June; no record of why any row lacks it | live DB; `generate-investment-report` phase 2 |
| F2 | D | Stored record contradicts itself: `keyMetrics.annualNet/weeklyNet` vs `projections.moderate[0].cashFlow` agree on **0 of 162** rows, median gap **$24,793**; legacy renderer prints the keyMetrics side, templates print the series | `cashFlowProjection.pure.ts` header; `render-investment-report-pdf` exec summary |
| F3 | D | Overrides go stale: saving `manual_overrides` does not recalculate; legacy renderer references the column **zero** times; only `{{overrides.*}}` carries corrections and no master binds it. 435 rows (37%) carry overrides | `ManualDataOverrideModal.tsx:1174`; grep of legacy renderer |
| F4 | D/T | Brand baked into content: generator writes `# BRAND / YOUR DEDICATED PROPERTY PARTNER / Investment Report: …` into `report_content`; `narrative.source` republishes it verbatim, so templated documents print a second, generation-time cover inside the body (verified on a real render — including the literal heading "Cover Page") | `generate-investment-report:5311`; `compassSectionRegistry.ts` cover section `includeInCompass: true` |
| F5 | D | Missing source data is silent: Phase-1 service failures only log to console; nothing on the row records completeness | `generate-investment-report:2541-2575` |
| F6 | P | The two investment pathways differ in **content**: legacy adds a self-authored executive summary, an "Editor's Note", and hero photography; the templated path has none of these | `render-investment-report-pdf:3025-3055`, hero reads at `:2702-2730` |
| F7 | R | Charts drawn by two implementations (legacy's 11 private SVG renderers vs shared `vizFigures`) | both files |
| F8 | D | Reports unlinked from clients: `client_property_id` on 2/1,174; no client name on the row | live DB |
| F9 | P | Two engines answer to "Financial": `TierSwitcher` generates it via condense (model) while `ReportVariantControls` forks it (deterministic); both address the same child row and regenerate in place | `TierSwitcher.tsx:99`; `ReportVariantControls.tsx:30`; `condense-investment-report:404` |
| F10 | P | Sub-reports go stale silently: children refresh only on click; nothing compares child freshness to the parent's `updated_at` | `fork-investment-report`, `condense-investment-report` |
| F11 | P | The report page's primary "Download" produces a **.txt dump**; the PDF exits live lower in the export panel | `InvestmentReportView.tsx:136-151` |
| F12 | P/T | **Send to Client / client portal never receive the templated document**: they ship stored `pdf_url` (written by legacy route *or* browser generator, whichever last) or a fresh browser PDF | `SendToClientModal.tsx:159-199`; `InvestmentReportView.tsx:282`; `PortalReports.tsx:82-114` |
| F13 | T | The template invariant is process-enforced only: binding expressions permit arithmetic (`{{=financials.x * 1.1}}` passes `SAFE_EXPR_RE`), so nothing mechanical stops an approved template computing a figure | `bindingResolver.ts:193` |
| F14 | T | `client_branding_profiles` (the Templates → Branding tab) is a decoy: nothing in the reporting engine reads it | `BrandingManager.tsx`; grep of `applyOrganisationAndBrand` chain |
| F15 | T | `whitelabel_settings.company_name` stored with trailing space (no visual effect — the projection trims; data hygiene only) | live DB |
| F16 | P | Market Intelligence scheduled email has nothing to attach: `pdf_storage_path` is 0/7 (only the unused server persist path writes it); the labelled "Generate Report" button is the browser jsPDF path, which persists nothing | live DB; `MarketIntelligencePDFGenerator.ts` |
| F17 | D | Model prose contradicts structured facts: a real report states "3 bedrooms" (×3, including the closing summary) for a 4-bedroom subject; nothing reconciles prose against `property_specs` on any pathway | real render, pages 27/28/32 |
| F18 | R | Truncation leaves skeletons: `truncateNarrativeToCap` keeps headings while deleting their prose and appends a literal "…" — nine content-less headings and eight severed sentences on one real document | `compassPostProcessor.ts:190-210` |
| F19 | R | Markdown paging under-fills by ~2×: fixed `DEFAULT_LINES_PER_PAGE = 34` undershoots the rendered frame; 26 consecutive pages at 30–60% full; lead-in lines stranded above white | `reports/markdownPaging.pure.ts:16` |
| F20 | R | Loose ordered lists render as separate `<ol>`s — a 15-item checklist numbered "1., 1., 1., …" | `reports/markdown.pure.ts:985-1012`, `listHtml` ~`:1245` |
| F21 | R | A table row can be clipped with its continuation drawn above the running head and lost — observed mid-word on a real risk register | real render, pages 29→30 |
| F22 | D | The money page doesn't foot: upfront total $500 short of its own column; net position $2,176 off the visible rows (stored totals vs stored lines) | real render, page 6; `financial-calculator-service` outputs |
| F23 | R | The company/back page renders in a different palette and typeface from the template family around it | real render, page 36 |
| F24 | R | Footnote syntax (`[^abs]`) prints as body copy — no footnote handling in the Markdown renderer | `reports/markdown.pure.ts` |
| F25 | R | Part numbering counts pages, not sections: running heads reach "Part 49" on an 11-section document; two pages share "07" | `reports/investment/render.pure.ts:380` |

Minor (unnumbered): display heading overrun on one risk page; duplicated
headings 16 pages apart; pseudo-tables flattened to bullets; raw scoring-band
strings ("Good walkability (50-69)") and enum values reaching client prose;
mixed minus glyphs; "andother" missing space; contents labels disagreeing with
page headings.

## 4 · What verified sound

- **The template invariant holds on real data**: one live Compass row rendered
  through two families produced 81 currency/percent figures each, identical
  except each family's KPI strip curating a different *published* figure.
  Switching templates changes presentation only.
- **The selection chain**: 159 repo tests pass (route enforcement, resolver
  parity ×3, selection rules, seeded master through the real render boundary,
  font policy, brand-mark rules, adoption idempotency). Selections are re-read
  and re-validated server-side; stale choices fall back with a notice.
- **White-label sources are live and correctly keyed**: `report`/`reportMono`
  logo slots uploaded and matching the resolver's spelling; ABN, address,
  phone, disclaimer present in `global_report_settings`.
- **Typed design-system pages are professional**: fixture harness renders all
  formats with zero high-severity findings; real cash-flow tables are
  immaculate (banded, aligned, unwrapped numerals, semantic negatives).
- **The sub-report mechanism**: fork inheritance, idempotency, and one
  selection driving the whole family (compass + tiers fold to one key, active
  masters exist under both raw spellings).
- **Pipeline health**: watchdog keeps `investment_reports` at 1 stale row;
  production template renders succeeded on the audit date.

## 5 · Pathway / duplication register

**Same report, competing engines (user-visible):** investment's six exits
(.txt, template route, legacy server route, browser pdf-lib, Send-to-Client,
listings-modal jsPDF); Q&A's two exporters; Comparison's model-rewrite-per-
download beside the deterministic route; Market Intelligence's labelled jsPDF
button vs typeset popover; Cash Flow's four PDF exits; Client Details' Formara
twin; `FlattenPdfIconButton` on 18 surfaces. Commercial Capacity is the
consolidated model: one road.

**Same logic, multiple copies:** cash-flow cascade ×3 (the F2 divergence);
template resolver ×3; report-type normaliser ×2; chart primitives ×2;
browser/server calculator mirrors (`lenderLvrCaps.ts` and
`capitalAllocationLedger.ts` measurably drifted); orphaned
`buildTemplateBindingContext.ts` (three documented defects, zero callers);
drifted `compassSectionRegistry` mirror (672 vs 174 lines).

**Same name, different product:** "Financial" (F9); two unrelated "10 Year
Cash Flow" reports (investment modal vs commercial calculator print view).

**Dead but shipped:** `EnhancedInvestmentReportModal`, `QAPDFGenerator`,
`HybridPDFTemplate`, `StrictPDFTemplate`, `ClientPDFTemplate`,
`reportTemplate/pdfRenderer.ts`.

## 6 · Consolidation programme (draft — sequencing for owner sign-off)

Priorities agreed during the audit: accuracy · consistency · reliability ·
template compatibility · rendering quality · user experience. Legacy pathways
stay reachable throughout; **hiding them is a later, separately authorised
step**.

**A — Narrative channel (fixes most of what a client sees; small, local):**
exclude the Cover Page section from Compass assembly (the contents section
precedent is recorded in the registry's own header); truncation drops a heading
with its prose and never emits "…"; calibrate/measure markdown paging against
the rendered frame + keep-with-next for lead-ins; merge loose ordered lists and
carry `start`; strip or render footnote syntax; number parts by section, not
page; keep table rows whole across breaks; theme the company page from the
template family.

**B — Data-layer reconciliation (accuracy):** reconcile model prose against
`property_specs` at the enrichment boundary and fail loudly (F17); make
`financial_calculations` internally consistent or publish one side only (F2,
F22); record per-source fetch outcomes on the row (F5); regenerate-on-override
or stamp staleness (F3); investigate and alarm on missing fincalc (F1).

**C — Delivery unification (reach):** route Send-to-Client / portal / scheduled
sends through the same template-first delivery the downloads use (F12, F16);
make the report page's primary Download produce the document, not a .txt
(F11); single writer for `pdf_url`.

**D — Sub-report cascade:** one engine per variant name (fork for
financial/strategic, condense for briefing/snapshot — remove `financial` from
condense's accepted tiers or repoint `TierSwitcher`) (F9); staleness marker
against the parent (F10); regenerate children on parent regeneration or offer
one-click "refresh family".

**E — Invariant hardening:** refuse arithmetic over financial namespaces in the
production template guard (F13); retire or wire `client_branding_profiles`
(F14); write a `report_render_events` row from legacy paths and include
`template_render_jobs` in the coverage measure so the number tells the truth.

**F — Later, upon authorisation:** hide (not delete) the legacy generators
behind the unified delivery; retire dead components; fold the duplicated logic
copies onto their canonical modules.

## 7 · Reproduction

- Fixture harness: `npx tsx scripts/reports/renderAll.mts` (WeasyPrint 69 +
  `weasyprint-service/fonts/` installed locally; poppler-utils for
  `pdftoppm`/`pdftotext`).
- Real-row template render: build the projection data exactly as
  `scripts/template-library/productionFit.ts` does (`investmentData`), render
  with `renderTemplateToHtml(schema, { data, fontSource: 'container' })`, and
  measure with `scripts/reports/measure_pages.py`.
- Live counts: the SQL in `COVERAGE.md`, plus `template_render_jobs`,
  `report_template_selections`, `report_templates` grouped by
  engine/scope/active.

## 8 · Phase 0 + Phase 1A — implemented (2026-09-02)

The first two phases of §6's programme shipped together, and every number
below was re-measured on the same two production rows §5 measured, so the
before and after are the same instrument.

### Phase 0 — the measure

`public.report_render_coverage` (migration `20260915100000`) unions the nine
`*_renders` ledgers, `template_render_jobs`, and engine-tagged
`activity_logs` events into one engine × format × week matrix. The write side
is two pieces: `src/lib/secureInvoke.ts` auto-tags every successful
`render-*-pdf` / `render-template-pdf` invocation (the meteredFetch pattern —
coverage a new call site cannot forget), and `src/lib/reports/renderEvent.ts`
is the explicit helper for the ledgerless pathways, wired into the stored-PDF
chokepoint (`clientPdfDownload`), Formara, the Market Intelligence jsPDF
buttons and the portfolio pdf-lib generator. Remaining minor surfaces (print
views, flatten buttons, the QA editors, the commercial/industrial utils, the
listings modal) are listed for the same one-line treatment in the follow-up.

### Phase 1A — the narrative channel, calibrated and cleaned

`scripts/reports/markdownCalibration.mts` is the new measuring instrument: it
rendered probes through the real seeded Chancery master twice — pager in
charge, then bucket cap lifted — and found the pager sending every narrative
page at **40–47% of its measured capacity** (~54.5 rendered line-units per
continuation page, ~42.5 on the first; prose wraps at ~98 chars, the charge
model said 65). That under-fill was every "large sectional gap".

What changed (all charge-model changes are opt-in per format via
`resolveNarrativeProfile`; every uncalibrated caller is byte-identical):

- **Measured charges + calibrated budgets** for the investment narrative
  (`markdownPaging.pure.ts`, `markdown.pure.ts:charging`), resolved
  identically by the markdown block and the projection so the conditional
  page count and the drawn buckets cannot disagree. The deployed schemas'
  baked `linesPerPage: 34` is read as the legacy sentinel.
- **Keep-with-next**: a page never ends on a heading or a lead-in line
  ending in a colon.
- **Tables split by rows with the head repeated** when taller than a page
  (`splitTableBlock`), charged by real cell wrap — the clipped risk-register
  row (F21) is structurally impossible now.
- **Loose lists merge** (fifteen "1." items are one list again) and ordered
  runs keep their opening number (F20).
- **Footnotes render**: `[^id]` becomes a superscript with a Notes list;
  a citation-shaped ref with no definition strips instead of printing (F24).
  `sup.fn-ref`/`ol.fn-notes` joined the print stylesheet's vocabulary.
- **Skeleton headings drop** (`dropEmptyHeadings`, default on) and the
  word-cap truncation now cuts cleanly: no heading survives its deleted
  prose, no literal "…", while figures and tables still always survive
  (F18, and the standing figures-and-tables rule).
- **The baked cover is gone twice over**: `compass.cover` is excluded from
  generation (the contents-section precedent), and
  `reports/investment/narrativeClean.pure.ts` strips the masthead and
  "Cover Page" section out of the 1,100+ stored narratives at read time, on
  both sides of the contract (F4).
- **Scorecard band jargon is cleaned at the projection** — "Good walkability
  (50-69)" publishes as "Good walkability" (the F-series readability item).

Measured on the same rows as §5: 48 Budgeree via the user's selected
Dictionary master went **36pp → 22pp, median body ink 0.055 → 0.111**, with
every narrative page inside the native 0.10–0.13 band, zero cover/masthead
artefacts, zero footnote syntax; the 6 Acer Court financial fork via Chancery
went **21pp → 15pp, median 0.097**, risk register split with repeated heads
and no severed row. The remaining sparse pages are the typed fixed-geometry
pages (contents, dashboard, property, sources) — Phase 1B's schema-side
economy work, alongside the part-numbering and back-page theming that also
live in the seeded schemas.

### Phase 1B — the schema-side pass (2026-09-02, same day)

- **One part number for the whole report body.** Every narrative continuation
  page minted its own — running heads marched "Part 08 · Report" through
  "Part 33", and Sources introduced itself as Part 49 with a two-inch numeral.
  The opener mints the label once and every continuation (and the cut page)
  carries it verbatim; a Compass now runs Part 01–09. The labels are baked
  into schema furniture, so the fix ships as the v9 catalogue seed
  (`20260916100000`) plus a reactivation migration (`20260916110000`) that
  refreshes every active row from its published entry — the same mechanism,
  guards and colourway-exclusion as `20260816150000`, with a probe that no
  active investment schema still carries "Part 15 · Report".
- **The closing page dresses in the family's tokens.** `disclaimer.html.ts`
  hardcoded a foreign ground (#141414), one of the audit's eight stray golds
  (#BF9B50) and a Helvetica fallback — the critic's "back cover from a
  different design system". It now reads the colourway (`bg`,
  `accentOnField`, `text`, `mutedOnField`, the heading face), with the old
  literals as fallbacks so token-less templates render unchanged. The
  split wordmark (every word large, the last small beneath — "SERVICES" as a
  subtitle) is one name at one size in the family's heading face.
- **Deliberately not done here, and why:** the typed front-matter pages
  (contents, dashboard) measure sparse and are left so — front matter in a
  premium document is airy by intent, and densifying it is a family-design
  decision for the Claude Design catalogue, not a defect fix. The data-sparse
  typed pages on financially-empty rows are queued with Phase 2's
  completeness work, where the row-level `when:` guards already carry most of
  it.

## 9 · Phase 2 — accuracy gates (2026-09-02)

Phase 2 set out to make the Investment report's figures one truth end to end.
Reconnaissance for it found something larger than the divergence the audit
had measured: **every stored 10-year projection series was charging the
property's operating costs roughly three times over.**

### F26 — the projection fold triple-charged operating costs

`generateProjections` (financial-calculator-service) folded
`Object.values(annualCosts)` into its cost base, and that object carries its
own totals (`totalAnnual`, `totalAnnualExcludingLandTax`) and a percentage
beside the line items — so the opex base was
`2·totalAnnual + totalAnnualExcludingLandTax + percent`. Proven to the
dollar on the captured production row ($1.19M NSW house, rent $739/wk):

|                                   | stored | honest |
|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|
| Year-1 operating costs charged    | **$59,931** | $22,232 (totalAnnual × 1.038 CPI) |
| Year-1 cash flow (moderate)       | **−$92,557** | −$54,858 |
| Year-1 ROI                        | **−18.89%** | −3.05% |
| 10-year cumulative position       | overstated by ~**$370k** | — |

The buggy base reconstructs exactly: 2×21,418 + 14,893 + 7 = $57,736, and
×1.038 (that day's cached year-1 CPI) = $59,930 ≈ the stored charge. The
headline `keyMetrics` used a third base (un-escalated, land tax out), so one
page contradicted itself by $43,885/yr — and the generator's prompt injected
the poisoned series verbatim as the cash-flow table the model transcribes,
directly under a stated formula ("rent − operating costs − repayments")
whose quoted operating costs were the sane ones. The sensitivity analysis
carried the same fold twice more. Nobody could reconcile these numbers
because they were not reconcilable.

### F27 — adjacent accuracy defects, same commit series

- `totalUpfront` = deposit + duty + hardcoded $2,000 — ignoring the row's
  own `legalFees`/`inspectionFees` lines (historic rows off by $500+); the
  cash-on-cash denominator was a second hardcoded derivation.
- The prompt forced **accounting-negative notation onto positive cash
  flows** (`($X)` via `Math.abs`), taught that P&I repayments decline ~5% by
  year 10 (they are constant; the split changes), bound `p.lvr` — a field
  the series never had — printing the literal "XX%", and asserted "all
  scenarios produce negative cumulative cashflow" unconditionally.
- Manual overrides reached `financial_calculations` by three writers, all
  splatting values over computed leaves: the captured row carries overridden
  line items summing $13,578 beside `totalAnnual` $21,418, with projections
  and metrics describing neither (C5's defect, proven on the same row).

### What shipped

- **C1 — one engine, one cost base**
  (`_shared/reports/investment/financialEngine.pure.ts`). All calculator
  arithmetic extracted pure and pinned by `financialEngine.spec.ts` against
  the captured row; the service keeps orchestration only. Projections,
  sensitivity and headline cash flow share `operatingExpensesFrom` (the
  footed total, never a fold); the year-0→year-1 gap is exactly the declared
  escalation. The one deliberate asymmetry: net rental **yield** keeps the
  land-tax-excluded base (land tax follows the owner's aggregated holdings,
  not the property) and the report states the exclusion. Cash-on-cash
  divides by the same `totalUpfront` the report prints. The prompt's
  narrative figures are now derived FROM the series (`impliedOpexFromSeries`,
  `fmtCashFlow`, `seriesLvrPercent`, `cumulativeCashFlow`), so prose and
  table cannot disagree; the sign convention keeps the sign, and the
  cumulative-cashflow teaching is conditional on the data.
- **C2 — historic rows healed at every read boundary**
  (`reconcileStoredFinancials`). ~1,170 stored rows carry the fold; nothing
  rewrites them until regeneration, so readers heal them exactly: the fold
  base reconstructs from the row's own aggregates (original even where line
  items were overridden — nothing ever rewrote the aggregates), each year's
  CPI factor recovers as impliedOpex ÷ base, and cash flow, cumulative and
  ROI follow. Detection cannot misfire (buggy year-1 charge ≥ 2× totalAnnual;
  healthy ≤ ~1.1×). Totals are derived from the row's own lines; headline
  metrics recompute from components. Wired at the template binding
  projection, the legacy `render-investment-report-pdf` route (its 10-year
  and cash-flow charts drew the inflated series on every historic re-render),
  and the design-composer normaliser. Idempotent, never mutates the stored
  row, no-op on post-fix rows. Historic **prose** is beyond render-time
  repair — regeneration is the remedy, and regeneration now writes correct
  figures.
- **C5 — overrides go INTO the engine, on every writer**
  (`overrides.pure.ts`). An override that changes a modelled input (price,
  rent, rate, reviewed costs, duty, conveyancing) becomes calculator INPUT —
  `calculateAnnualCosts` takes the reviewed figures, an explicit $0 replaces
  the estimate, letting fees join the totals, and the totals foot against
  the final lines whoever supplied them. Only non-modelled fields (tax
  treatment, occupancy display, build splits, loan labels) merge afterwards,
  through one shared `applyDisplayOverrides`. `manage-investment-reports`
  recomputes server-side before the write (never blocking the save; the
  response and the modal's toast say which happened), and the generator's
  30-line splat loop is gone.
- **C3 — fact reconciliation** (`factReconciliation.pure.ts`). The prose is
  compared with the record at completion — bedrooms, bathrooms, car spaces,
  purchase price, weekly rent, land size. Report-level rule (recorded value
  never appears + a different value repeats) so comparative prose cannot
  trip it; money facts are context-anchored. Findings disclose as
  `validation_flags` `type:'fact'` entries in lay wording and never gate
  completion. Feeding findings into regeneration retries is deliberately
  deferred until the detector has production mileage.
- **C4 — completeness recorded and disclosed, no schema change.**
  `data_sources` now records all eleven attempted sources (was four) —
  present with provenance, or null as a recorded fact. The viewer's new
  `InvestmentReportCoverageNote` renders ONLY when a source is missing or a
  fact check flagged ("9 of 11 sources", the gaps named, each contradiction
  in a sentence); a complete, clean report shows nothing, because a badge
  must mean something is unmet. Carried on the detail projection of
  `get-investment-reports`.

### Verification

63 new spec assertions across `financialEngine.spec.ts`,
`investmentOverrides.spec.ts`, `factReconciliation.spec.ts` — the engine
pinned against the captured production row (its reconstruction reproduces
the stored totals and monthly payment exactly, and the heal reproduces the
stored corruption before repairing it). Full affected surface green: 2,330
tests, tsc, eslint, `audit:style` under baseline, production build.

### Deferred, with reasons

- Regeneration-retry wiring for fact findings (detector mileage first).
- Browser viewer chart components reading `financial_calculations` directly
  (the two live PDF routes and the composer are healed; the viewer's own
  charts join in the delivery-unification phase).
- Historic prose corrections (regeneration is the remedy; C1 makes every
  regeneration correct).

## 10 · Phase 3 — delivery unification (2026-09-02)

Programme item C: every pathway that puts an Investment document in front of
a person produces THE document — template-first, one implementation — and
the scheduled Market Intelligence email can finally attach one.

### What shipped

- **`deliverInvestmentPdf.ts` — investment's own `deliver*` module.** The
  correct chain (the person's chosen template → the legacy WeasyPrint
  route) existed once, inside `PremiumPdfButton`. It is the module now, in
  the same shape every other migrated format has, and every surface asks
  it. `templateRouteEnforcement`'s investment pins moved onto the module,
  which makes them stronger: they now guard the path every surface uses
  rather than one button.
- **F11 — the primary Download produces the document.** The page's main
  action (header, mobile bar) had saved the markdown as a `.txt` for the
  life of the page while the real PDF sat lower in a collapsible panel. It
  now delivers template-first with a busy state, and says "Download PDF".
  The raw-text export survives everywhere its label already said "raw
  text": the panel button, the header menu item, the document card.
- **F12 — Send to Client publishes what the operator reviewed.** The send
  produced nothing before: it shipped whatever `pdf_url` held (legacy
  route or browser raster, whichever wrote last) or minted a fresh raster.
  It now produces fresh through the same chain, uploads template renders,
  reuses the path the legacy route just persisted rather than re-uploading
  the same bytes, and falls back to the raster only when both engines fail
  — reachability kept, primacy corrected. The portal needed no change: it
  serves the snapshot it was sent, and the snapshot is now the document.
- **`pdf_url` has one meaning**: the storage path of the most recent
  standard-delivery document, recorded through the one
  `manage-investment-reports` broker (the module and the browser
  generator's bookkeeping both go through it; the legacy route's internal
  write is the same delivery's server half).
- **F16 — the scheduled Market Intelligence email renders its own
  attachment.** The dispatcher's generate step writes content, never a
  PDF, so every dispatch that had to generate failed before sending
  (`pdf_storage_path` 0/7 in production). It now reuses a recent report
  even when that report carries no PDF yet, renders through the same
  design-composer route the download button uses (`persist` on), and
  attaches the path handed back. The route still refuses anonymous
  service_role exactly as pinned; the dispatch acts FOR the schedule's
  creator, whose `marketing_analytics` permission the route checks under a
  delegated authMethod that cannot hit the permission short-circuit.

### Verification

18 behavioural assertions on the delivery module (chain order, option
forwarding, publish reuse-vs-upload, bookkeeping-never-fails-a-document)
plus the `investmentDeliveryUnified` source pins (F11/F12/F16 wiring by
name). Full affected surface green: 6,243 tests, `tsc`, eslint,
`audit:style` under baseline, production build; MI's `legacyPathStays`
route pins all hold; security inventory regenerated with the new
dispatcher→render edge.

### Deliberately not done here

- The orphaned investment design-composer (`buildInvestmentReport` /
  `render.pure.ts`) stays orphaned: it is the legacy monolith's eventual
  replacement and belongs to the separately-authorised legacy phase (F),
  not to delivery unification.
- `ClientPDFGenerator`'s client-side override splat (a fourth copy) is
  harmless now that stored financials are override-coherent (Phase 2 C5)
  and folds with the duplicate-copy work.

## 11 · Phase 4 — sub-report cascade (2026-09-02)

Programme item D: the Compass family behaves as one family — one engine per
variant name, one linkage, and staleness that shows itself.

### What the phase found live (beyond the register)

- **F9 was structural, not just a mis-routed button.** The two engines used
  DIFFERENT linkage columns (fork → `derived_from_report_id`, condense →
  `parent_report_id`) with different idempotency keys, so neither could see
  the other's child: one Compass could hold two contradictory "Financial"
  documents, one deterministic and one model-written.
- **F28 — the tier switcher read `investment_reports` from the browser.**
  The table's policies are service-role-only, so the sibling lookup always
  answered `[]` with HTTP 200: switching to an existing child was
  impossible and every click regenerated one (model spend included). The
  fourth surface to hit the read-through-the-server trap.
- **A regenerated condense child kept its first-creation data copies.**
  Regeneration rewrote the prose and left `financial_calculations`,
  demographics, specs et al. as copied on day one — fresh words over stale
  figures.
- **Every fork was scored against $0.** The fork's score inputs read
  `financial_calculations.purchasePrice` / `.weeklyRent` — paths the record
  never had (the figures live at `initialCosts.propertyValue` and
  `income.weeklyRent`).

### What shipped

- **`subReportFamily.pure.ts`** — one mapping (`engineForVariant`:
  financial/strategic → fork, briefing/snapshot → condense), family
  resolution across BOTH historical linkage columns, and derived staleness
  (`variant_generated_at` vs the parent's `updated_at`; missing stamps never
  cry wolf). Bridged to src; both switchers route through the shared
  `generateSubReport`, and `condense-investment-report` refuses
  `financial` at the server, naming the right engine.
- **`familyOf` on `get-investment-reports`** — the family read, server-side,
  under the reports module gate: two indexed lookups (never a composed
  `.or()` string), per-child staleness in the answer. `TierSwitcher` uses it
  (its direct browser query is gone), lists all five variants including
  Strategic, and shows "parent has changed since" on stale rows.
- **Staleness stamps and honest refreshes.** Condense stamps
  `variant_generated_at` on completion and refreshes the structured copies
  from the parent on regeneration; both engines write both linkage columns
  on new rows.
- **`InvestmentReportFamilyNotice`** on the report page: renders nothing
  when the family is clean; on a stale child, one "Refresh from latest
  data"; on a parent, which sub-reports lag and one click that refreshes
  exactly the children that already exist — a refresh never mints documents
  nobody asked for. Fork refreshes are free (deterministic); condense
  refreshes cost a generation and the button counts what it touches.
- **Fork scores read the record** (override → initialCosts/income), not
  absent top-level paths.

### Verification

31 assertions across the pure-module spec (engine mapping, dual-column
family resolution from any anchor, the staleness truth table, orphan and
incomplete-child handling) and the source pins (server refusal, no inline
engine choice on any surface, no browser table read, stamps and structured
refresh present, page wiring). Full affected surface green: 2,356 report
tests, `tsc`, eslint, `audit:style` under baseline, production build, edge
column gate; security inventory unchanged (no new call edges).

### Deliberately not done here

- Auto-regenerating children when a parent regenerates: a condense refresh
  spends a model generation, so the family refresh stays an explicit,
  counted click on the page rather than a silent side effect of every
  parent save.
- Backfilling the two linkage columns into one: readers resolve the union
  either way; a data migration is pure tidiness and can ride with any later
  schema work.

## 12 · Phase 5 — invariant hardening (2026-09-02)

Programme item E: the rules the engine lived by become rules the machine
enforces.

### F13 — the template invariant is mechanical now

A template FORMATS data; it never COMPUTES it. `{{= financials.x * 1.1 }}`
used to pass the expression evaluator's character whitelist, so an approved
template could print a figure no engine produced. One implementation
(`templateLibraryCore.pure.ts`), two layers:

- **`expressionComputesOverData`** refuses arithmetic over ANY data
  reference — not only the financial namespaces, because a computed figure
  under `property.*` fabricates as readily as one under `financials.*`.
  Selection stays legal (ternaries, comparisons, `&&` presence logic choose
  between engine-supplied values); pure-literal arithmetic touches no data.
  Deliberately strict: `financials.x > -1` is refused (write `>= 0`) — a
  stricter refusal beats a parser.
- **The publish gate** (`validateForPublish`, code
  `library_template_computes`) refuses a computing schema with the
  offending expressions named, so no library entry can ship one.
- **The binding resolver** refuses at evaluation — the always-on stop for
  schemas that never meet the gate (activated copies, user drafts,
  imports). A computing expression resolves to nothing, like every refused
  expression; never to an invented figure.

Measured first, pinned after: zero of the 543 seeded templates use
expression arithmetic at all — `templateComputePolicy.spec.ts` asserts it
per template across all twelve collections, so the measured fact stays a
fact. 24 assertions on the rule, the walker, the gate and the runtime stop.

### F14 — the Branding decoy is retired

Templates → Branding collected per-client logos and colours into
`client_branding_profiles`, and no document generator ever read a row —
an operator configuring it was being promised branding the reports never
applied. The tab and `BrandingManager.tsx` are deleted rather than left
dormant (the platform's own rule: a dormant component is one import away
from returning). Untouched: the table, its rows, the `manage-templates`
allow-list, and the `ai-dashboard-agent` listing tool that reads the table
as data. The real brand source remains `whitelabel_settings` through the
brand resolvers; per-client REPORT branding, if ever wanted, is a
design-system feature on that chain and goes through Claude Design.

### E's third bullet — verified already delivered

"Write render events from legacy paths; include `template_render_jobs` in
the coverage measure" shipped in Phase 0: the `report_render_coverage`
view unions the nine `*_renders` ledgers, `template_render_jobs`, and
engine-tagged activity events, and the legacy investment route is
auto-tagged `legacy_server` by `secureInvoke`. Nothing further owed.

### Deliberately not folded

`compassSectionRegistry` / `compassPostProcessor` keep their src/edge
mirror pairs: the duplication is deliberate (edge functions cannot import
`src/`), drift-guarded by `compassRegistryParity.spec.ts`, and the src
copies carry src-only content below the shared block — a fold is churn,
not hardening. `ClientPDFGenerator`'s client-side override merge likewise
stays: it is the browser generator's compatibility shim for historic rows
whose stored financials predate the Phase 2 recalculation.

### Verification

6,709 template-suite tests green (the golden-render byte-stability guard
included — the refusal branch changes no rendered byte of a
non-computing template), `tsc`, eslint (0 errors), `audit:style` under
baseline, production build, edge column gate; security inventory
unchanged.

## 13 · Phase F — legacy incorporation and hiding (2026-09-02, upon authorisation)

The owner's standing instruction was that the legacy system be "incorporated
and hidden at a later stage once authorization is provided"; the
authorisation arrived after Phase 5 merged, and this phase is that step. The
model for what "incorporated and hidden" means was already in the tree: the
Borrowing Capacity Snapshot's one control offering the server render as the
primary act and the in-browser generator as an explicitly named
"legacy layout" choice — a decision its own spec records was taken so the
generator's retirement from reachability would never happen by accident.
Phase F generalises that arrangement to every format that still had
competing exits, deletes what nothing could reach, and folds the duplicate
logic copies the earlier phases had deferred here.

### Dead code deleted, not left dormant

Seven files with zero reachable callers went: `EnhancedInvestmentReportModal`,
`QAPDFGenerator` (whose unreachability the Q&A contract had recorded for two
migrations — the spec now pins the *deletion* so nobody restores it from
history), `HybridPDFTemplate`, `StrictPDFTemplate`, `ClientPDFTemplate`,
`reportTemplate/pdfRenderer.ts`, and the orphaned
`_shared/buildTemplateBindingContext.ts` (three documented defects, zero
callers). The style ratchet was re-measured downward in the same edit —
hexLiterals 636→611, fontHardcoded 53→51 — because the deleted print
components carried much of the recorded backlog. The orphaned investment
design-composer (`buildInvestmentReport`) turned out NOT to be dead — its
modules feed `reportBindingProjection` and `compassSectionRegistry`, i.e.
the template path itself — so it stays, and the §10 note that called it
orphaned is superseded by that measurement.

### The folds

**The read-boundary heal now covers the browser.** `get-investment-reports`
reconciles `financial_calculations` through `reconcileStoredFinancials`
before any row leaves the service — the same heal the two PDF routes and
the binding projection have applied since Phase 2 — so browser charts, the
library summaries and the legacy browser generator read one set of figures.
This closes the Phase 2 deferral ("the viewer's own charts join in the
delivery-unification phase") at a single server-side point instead of
per-component.

**The fourth override-splat copy is folded and named.**
`ClientPDFGenerator`'s hand-written flat-key→path merge is now
`overlayOverridesForHistoricRow` in `overrides.pure.ts` — the modelled
overlay a pre-recompute-era row needs, then the ordinary display paths —
documented as a display compromise for historic rows, never a recompute,
and a no-op on current rows. `applyDisplayOverrides` shares the same splat
mechanics (`splatByPaths`), so the path-walking exists once. The modal's
`OVERRIDE_FIELD_PATHS` deliberately stays: it is the override editor's own
field metadata (broader vocabulary, read-back concern), not a competing
money path.

**The browser/server mirror pairs were measured and left.**
`lenderLvrCaps`, `capitalAllocationLedger` and `scenarioDeltaEngine` are
deliberate structural twins with parity tests
(`scenario_parity_test.ts`, `lender_shading_parity_test.ts`, in place since
2026-08-30): the lenderLvrCaps constants are byte-identical, the ledger's
numeric content identical modulo comment counting, and the size difference
is inlined types on the Deno side. The §5 "measurably drifted" note is
superseded by that measurement; folding them would repeat the
`compassSectionRegistry` churn §12 already declined.

### One road per format, with the legacy named behind it

- **Investment** — all six exits now converge. The listings modal's
  "Download PDF" delivers through `deliverInvestmentPdf` (template-first,
  legacy server route behind it); its raw-text jsPDF dump survives only for
  an unsaved generation, where no row exists to deliver. The three
  `ClientPDFGenerator` mounts (export panel, Generated Reports viewer, the
  client tab's download sheet) sit after the unified control as
  "Download (legacy layout)" — the browser pdf-lib generator keeps its ref
  because the send fallback still reaches it. The client tab's sheet gains
  the unified download it never had.
- **Market Intelligence** — generating no longer draws and auto-saves the
  legacy jsPDF (the browser engine was the default road nobody picked). The
  typeset control leads the success strip and the History modal rows; the
  legacy layout is drawn only when chosen, and the choice is labelled. The
  spec's "never a silent substitute" reasoning survives: nothing falls back
  across engines.
- **Client Details** — the typeset control is the toolbar's one primary
  document control; the two Formara raster buttons moved to the end of the
  toolbar, demoted and named ("Send to Finance (legacy layout)",
  "Download (legacy layout)"). They stay because the raster document
  carries capabilities the typeset one does not (owner-occupied toggle,
  borrowing-capacity appendix) and a broker's workflow may depend on the
  exact document.
- **Property Comparison** — `ComparisonPDFGenerator` used to spend a
  metered model call (`format-comparison-report`) on every viewer MOUNT,
  download or not. It now formats only when "Download (legacy layout)" is
  actually chosen — once per stored row, and the click that paid for the
  formatting gets its download (the generator handle gained a programmatic
  `download()` for exactly this). The deterministic typeset control was
  already first at both mounts.
- **Cash Flow / Cash Flow Comparison** — the 10 Year menu already carried
  the converged shape ("Generate PDF" server-first, legacy named beneath);
  the comparison modal's two jsPDF exports are now demoted ghosts labelled
  "(legacy layout)" beside the typeset controls that already led.
- **Report Q&A** — the toolbar's ambiguous "Export PDF" is now
  "Transcript (legacy layout)": it posts a pdf-lib *transcript* into the
  chat, a different document from the typeset structured report, which is
  why it remains a choice rather than being folded. The editors' own jsPDF
  exports stay untouched — they export user-EDITED content the server
  routes cannot see.
- **Borrowing Capacity, Portfolio, Commercial Capacity** — already
  conformant; nothing changed.

Out of scope, recorded: the quantitative-analysis viewer
(`pages/ReportViewer`), `PropertyReportGenerator`, `OverviewSnapshotPDF`,
the Strategy Rationale Brief, call-log and lender-packet exports are
standalone documents with no typeset twin — there is no unified delivery to
hide them behind, and inventing one is new-format work, not consolidation.

### Contracts renegotiated, not broken

Each affected `legacyPathStays` spec records the new decision in place of
the old one: Q&A pins the deletion; Market Intelligence pins "named choice,
drawn only when picked, never a side effect of generating"; Client Details
pins the order (unified first) and the naming. The specs that pinned
handlers, field names, destinations and server contracts pass unchanged —
demotion touched chrome, not machinery.

### Verification

2,360 report-suite tests green across 108 files (every legacyPathStays
contract included), `tsc` clean, eslint at exact error parity with `main`
(zero introduced), `audit:style` ratcheted down and holding, production
build, edge column-name gate, the security gate chain (registry, static,
authz, CORS, mass-assignment, public-validation et al.), and esbuild parse
checks for the touched Deno modules; security inventory unchanged (no new
internal call edge).

## 14 · Closing pass — every open finding and deferred item, measured and closed (2026-09-02)

The owner asked for whatever remained — "remaining phases and stray
patterns" — to be executed and the loops closed once and for all. The named
phases were complete, so this pass took the register's open findings and
every "deferred, with reasons" note in §9–§13, measured each against the
live system, and acted where the measurement supported action. What follows
is the whole list, including the items closed by *decision* rather than by
code, because a loop closed by "we looked, here is why not" is closed.

### Closed by code

**F17 at its source — the generator fabricated a bedroom count.**
`effectiveBeds` was `mergedOverrides.bedrooms || propertyDetails?.beds || 3`
(bathrooms `|| 2`), and the prompt's specification table read it, so a
property whose count was never captured was asserted to the model as "3
bedrooms" — which is exactly how a real report said "3 bedrooms" three
times about a four-bedroom subject. Measured the same day: **0 of the last
43 reports carry a bedroom count in `property_specs`** while 651 older ones
do, because the callers spell the facts four ways (`beds`/`bedrooms`,
`landSizeSqm`/`landSize`/`land_size_sqm`, `carSpaces`/`parking`) and every
site read exactly one; the specs write read `.landSize`, `.buildingSize`
and `.parking` while every caller sent `landSizeSqm`, `buildSizeSqm` and
`carSpaces`, so three of nine specs were null on every row whatever the
caller knew. Now: one normalisation, once, before anything reads a fact;
the FACT is null when unknown and the prose says "Not specified"; the
MODELLING DEFAULT (`modelledBeds`) exists separately and feeds only the
scorer and the rent lookup, which need a number to model with and never
reach a page. Pinned by `closingPass.spec.ts`.

**F17's detector, measured on production prose.** The regeneration-retry
deferral said "detector mileage first"; the detector had had none (0 rows
touched since Phase 2 merged), so it was run offline over 18 production
reports — 10 recent, 8 with bedroom counts. Result: **one true positive**
(a lot priced at $693,100 whose entire money section anchored on the suburb
median, $625,000, six times — the class disclosure exists for) and **one
false positive**: a spec list, "Bedrooms: 3 - Bathrooms: 2", whose " - "
separator the `[\s-]*` bridge read as the hyphen of "3-bathroom", while
the true label-first "Bathrooms: 2" never counted as the recorded value
appearing. Counted mentions now allow one separator character, label-first
forms are collected, and both production cases are pinned as tests.
**The retry itself is deliberately not wired**: one positive in eighteen is
not the volume that validates a section-scoped correction loop inside the
highest-volume generator's resume bookkeeping, and the fabrication fix
above removes the mechanism that produced the reported contradiction.
Disclosure stays the remedy; this measurement is recorded so the next
decision starts from evidence.

**F26's remaining readers.** `reconcileStoredFinancials` now runs where
the two comparison producers read rows (`compare-investment-reports`,
`compare-cash-flow-reports` — both were handing a model triple-charged
figures for historic rows) and inside `projectCashFlow` itself, so the 10
Year Cash Flow heals whatever path a row arrives by (browser adapters,
sample data, the live-projection carrier). The cash-flow render routes
turned out not to read the column at all — they render the snapshot the
adviser reviewed — so nothing was owed there.

**F28's class, five more instances.** `investment_reports`' SELECT policy
is `generated_by = auth.uid()` (plus the client-owner branch) — measured
from `pg_policies` — so a browser read answers with the current user's own
reports and calls it the whole: the Overview's "reports this month" was one
person's count, the Q&A library picker offered a user only their own
reports, a client's portfolio actions listed nothing for a colleague, the
auto-generated badge marked only your own rows, and the error-log retry's
status reset matched zero rows for anyone else's report and said nothing.
All five read through `get-investment-reports` (whose `listOptions`
already carried every filter needed) or write through
`manage-investment-reports`; the picker now fetches a body per pick rather
than 200 documents to draw a list. `closingPass.spec.ts` pins all six
files (the Phase 4 one included) against a table read.

**A sixth instance, found by the gate rather than by the sweep.** Removing
the browser client from the Q&A picker left one call behind, and CI's
undefined-identifier gate caught it — `check-src-missing-names.mjs`, the
one gate this repo keeps precisely because the app is never fully
type-checked (`tsconfig.json` declares `"files": []` and delegates to
project references, so a bare `tsc --noEmit` verifies **nothing**; that is
why a local run said clean). Looking at the line it named turned up a
defect older than this pass: the call read `client_properties`, whose only
SELECT policies are **service-role**, so it answered `[]` with HTTP 200 for
every user — and an empty property list short-circuits the picker to "no
reports" whenever it is opened for a client. It now reads through
`get-client-data`, which brokers that table behind the
`client_management` permission and a client filter. The lesson is the
gate's, not the sweep's: an import removed is an audit of every use of it.

**F15.** `manage-branding` trims string columns at the write boundary, and
the migration brings the stored `company_name` — trailing space, measured
— to what every reader was already trimming it to.

**Linkage columns.** 48 rows carried only `parent_report_id`, 20 only
`derived_from_report_id`, 0 disagreed where both were set; the migration
backfills each from the other, idempotently. Readers already resolved the
union, so no reading changes — the record is coherent now. All three
statements were planned against the live schema with `EXPLAIN` before being
committed (45, 17 and 4 estimated rows, matching the counts above); nothing
was executed against production.

**A test that failed for its own weight, not for a defect.**
`printFontPolicy.spec.ts` reads and regex-scans every
`seed_template_library` migration — **199 MB across nine files**, the
catalogue written out as SQL — under vitest's default **5-second**
allowance. Alone it takes about a second; in a loaded parallel run it took
**7.3 s** and failed the file, which is what "flaky" looked like from the
outside. The assertion is untouched and the scan is unchanged; only the
clock now reflects the work, so the gate fails when a face is missing
rather than when the machine is busy.

**A silent skip made visible.** The Q&A library picker now reads a body per
pick, and a completed report carrying no body cannot be asked questions
about. It names the ones it could not read rather than dropping them from
the selection without a word — a pick that vanishes with no reason reads as
a broken button.

### Closed by decision, with the measurement

- **F6 (content parity: hero photography, exec summary, editor's note).**
  The binding projection publishes no hero image and no master binds one;
  adding a cover photograph is a change to all fifty generated investment
  masters, which by the catalogue's own rule goes to Claude Design and
  comes back through the generator — recorded as the design-catalogue
  decision it is. The legacy route's render-time executive summary and
  editor's note were model calls made at RENDER; the templated document is
  the stored report, and a renderer that invents content is the invariant
  this programme exists to enforce. Not ported, deliberately.
- **F7 (legacy renderer's eleven private chart drawers vs `vizFigures`).**
  The legacy route is now the hidden fallback behind every unified
  delivery; rewriting its charts onto the shared primitives would be
  effort spent on a road nobody is offered. Left, named.
- **F8 (reports unlinked from clients).** 2 of 1,193 carry
  `client_property_id`; both came from the client tab, which links
  correctly. The other 1,191 were generated from listings or the report
  form, where no client exists to link — a post-hoc "link to client"
  affordance is a product feature, not a stray pattern.
- **Template resolver ×3.** The browser resolver calls the authoritative
  `resolve_report_template` SQL function first and falls back to a JS
  ranking parity-locked to the edge copy — one authority, two guarded
  mirrors. Report-type normaliser ×2: the browser re-exports the shared
  pure module. Both already folded; the register's note is superseded.
- **Minor unnumbered items.** Table rows keep together
  (`table.data tr { page-break-inside: avoid }`); contents labels derive
  from the spine; the scoring band strings are the engine's own one-line
  reasons carried for the wheel. "andother" and the mixed minus glyphs
  were prose defects in one generation, remedied by regeneration.

### Verification

Full vitest suite green end to end in one run — **1,071 files, 20,503
tests, 0 failures** (the two that failed the first pass were the font-policy
timeout above and one load-sensitive market-updates fixture, both green
now); `tsc` clean; eslint **0 errors** on every changed file; style ratchet
holding; production build; all seven touched Deno modules parsed with
esbuild and the edge type-check ratchet run locally with Deno installed —
**no file this changeset touches sits above its baseline**; the security
gate chain (registry, static, authz, CORS, mass-assignment,
error-disclosure, public-validation, migrations, portal boundaries);
security inventory regenerated and unchanged. Production measurements were
taken read-only through the project's SQL interface and are quoted above;
the migration was validated with `EXPLAIN` and never executed.

## 15 · The generation engine — a control that could never take effect (2026-09-04)

The owner sent a screenshot of the Investment Analysis page's **GENERATION
ENGINE** drop-down and asked a fair question: how is an operator meant to
know whether "the trimmed version" is the one to pick — and if it is now the
primary engine, name it Primary.

The answer is worse than the question assumed. **There was nothing to pick.**

### What the drop-down did

Nothing. `InvestmentReportGenerator.tsx` sends no `reportTier`, so the
generator's `rawTier` falls to its default:

```ts
const rawTier = propertyDetails?.reportTier || 'compass';
const isCompassTier = rawTier === 'compass' || rawTier === 'compass-40';
const generationEngine = isCompassTier || requestedEngine === 'compass-40'
  ? 'compass-40' : 'legacy';
```

`isCompassTier` is therefore **always true from that page**, and the engine
resolves to Compass whatever the operator selected. That is not a bug in the
resolution — the tier is the data-minimisation boundary, and an engine
preference must never be able to pull financial content into a non-financial
report — but it makes the control inert.

The drop-down opened on the option that never ran, and described it as the
safe one: *"Legacy Compass — Stable · Full DB template, ~12 chunks,
battle-tested."* Every quality gate this programme built runs under the
other one — the canonical section registry, `postProcessReportMarkdown`,
`runQAValidation` — all inside `if (compass40OverlayActive)`. So the default
was labelled *stable* and was in fact the ungated path, and it made no
difference either way.

**A dead control is worse than no control**, the rule this repository
already applies to the AUSTRAC path card. This one was worse than dead.

### What the column recorded

`generation_engine` was written **only by the browser**, at request time.
So the row recorded the *selection*, not the run. Measured on 2026-09-04:

| `report_tier` | `generation_engine` | rows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| compass | legacy | **1,124** |
| snapshot | legacy | 25 |
| briefing | legacy | 21 |
| strategic | legacy | 10 |
| financial | legacy | 10 |
| compass | compass-40 | 2 |
| briefing | compass-40 | 1 |

Every one of those 1,124 rows says "legacy" about a document the Compass
engine produced. **A record of what was requested is not a record of what
happened.** `generate-investment-report` now writes the column on the
completion update, from `compass40OverlayActive` — the flag that actually
governed the run.

The historic rows are **deliberately not backfilled**. The rows predating
the tier promotion genuinely did run on the legacy engine, and the honest
discriminator is `total_sections` (the Compass registry persists 17, the
legacy section list 12) rather than a date nobody can pin to a deployment.
Replacing one guess with another is not a repair; a regeneration now stamps
the truth on the rows it touches.

### What changed on screen

The page **states** the engine instead of offering it: *Compass — Primary*,
with what it produces and what it deliberately omits (purchase price, yield,
LVR, loan and ten-year cash flow belong to the Financial Analysis Report).
The name lives in `ENGINE_LABEL` in one module, because two literals is how
two screens come to disagree.

The Regenerate dialog carried the same two options, and there the choice was
not merely dead but **harmful**: on a Compass report the server overrides it,
and on a Financial Analysis report picking Compass would strip the financials
the report exists for. It is a statement now too, resolved from the report's
own record.

### The rule, in one place

`src/lib/reports/generationEngine.pure.ts` mirrors the server's expression —
tier first, caller preference only where the tier leaves the question open.
It is deliberately neither trimmed nor lower-cased, because the server
compares with `===`: a module whose whole job is to say what will happen
must not be kinder than the rule it reports. `generationEngineTruth.spec.ts`
reads the edge function's own source and fails when the two drift, the guard
`llmUsageBinding.pure.ts` already carries against the router.

### One defect found on the way

`useChunkedRegeneration` sent `reportTier: normaliseReportTier(...)`, and
that helper collapses **everything except `financial*` into `compass-40`**.
It is right for counting chunks and wrong for the tier, which is the
boundary the server resolves the engine from — so regenerating any of the
**56 production `snapshot` / `briefing` / `strategic` reports** would have
sent `compass-40`, and returned a Compass document in place of the report
that was there. It now sends the report's own stored tier and resolves the
engine through the shared rule.

Two smaller things fixed in passing: the dialog read the `detail` projection
(~95KB of report prose plus every JSON blob on the row) to read one string,
and passed `listOptions.select`, which that function documents as
"deprecated and deliberately ignored" — it takes `generationProgress` now.

### Verification

Full vitest suite green in one run — **1,075 files, 20,556 tests, 0
failures**; `check-src-missing-names` clean; the edge column-name gate and
the style-token ratchet both holding; eslint **0 errors on every changed
file** and the repo total down one (44, from 45 — a
pre-existing `prefer-as-const` in a file this touches); production build;
the edited edge function parsed with esbuild; the edge type-check ratchet run
under the Deno version CI resolves (`v2.x` → 2.9.6) with **no file above its
baseline**. A local Deno 2.1.4 reports four unrelated `builderStock` /
`immutableDocuments` files as regressed: they use `Uint8Array<ArrayBuffer>`,
which needs TypeScript 5.7, and they are clean under the CI toolchain — the
gate is only meaningful on the version CI pins. Production counts were taken
read-only through the project's SQL interface and are quoted above; nothing
was written to the database.

## 16 · The template picker becomes a gallery (2026-09-04)

The owner's ask, verbatim in intent: choosing a template from names alone is
not choosing — show the actual template styles, lead with **different design
families** rather than one family's variants stacked above the next family's
first appearance, and let it cascade to every report being generated.

### What was there

`ReportTemplatePicker` listed the catalogue as radio rows of text. For the
Investment format that is **sixty rows** — ten families × five layouts plus
the ten individual designs — in which "Sovereign Folio" and "Signal Dark"
are names nobody can rank without seeing them, and the five Private Banking
variants sat above Dark Executive's first appearance. Meanwhile the Template
Library's browse page already rendered every design's real first page
(`TemplateDocumentPreview` — the same `renderTemplateToHtml` the customer's
PDF goes through, with sample data), so the pictures existed one page away
from the decision they were for.

### What it is now

- **Families first.** One tile per design family — ten visually different
  documents — each tile the family's reference layout rendered for real, on
  the light-table sheet treatment the Library established. Opening a family
  reveals a tray with its five layouts and its ten curated colourway swatches,
  and choosing a colourway repaints every sheet in the tray, so "Oxblood or
  Platinum?" is answered by watching. The tray scrolls itself into reach when
  opened, because a family in the gallery's second row would otherwise reveal
  it below the fold — a click that appears to do nothing.
- **Individual designs** (the voice templates, no `designMeta`) sit beside
  the families as their own tiles, each with its own face.
- **Active rows with no library lineage** get a face too. Their rows carry no
  `preview_schema`, and the picker's projection deliberately never fetches
  `config`/`schema` whole — so page one and the token palette alone are
  fetched, lazily, only when the dialog is open with such a row to draw
  (`fetchActiveTemplatePreviewPages`; PostgREST `schema->pages->0`, measured
  at ~50KB across every active row in production, largest page 3.9KB). A row
  whose schema has no pages, or a failed fetch, degrades that tile to an
  empty sheet — a missing picture never takes the chooser down.
- **A stored selection is followed visually**: its family opens pre-expanded
  with the design checked and badged Current, its colourway pre-selected.

**Nothing behavioural changed.** The save flow (adopt-then-select,
idempotent on entry + version + colourway), the fold of active rows into the
designs they descend from, "Choose automatically", the unavailable-choice
alert, the non-WeasyPrint disclosure and the ownership model are all exactly
as `TEMPLATE_SELECTION.md` records them — the same tests assert them against
the new surface. And because every surface mounts this ONE dialog
(`ReportTemplateSelector`, `useReportTemplateMenu`, the Templates page's
bindings list — the map `templateRouteEnforcement.spec.ts` holds complete
against the adapter registry), the gallery reaches all nine production
formats' download controls without touching any of them.

### Measured in a real engine

jsdom has neither layout nor iframes, so a DOM test passes while every tile
paints blank. `tests-e2e/report-template-picker/` mounts the real dialog in
Chromium over **sixteen real catalogue rows** (the ten family references,
all five Private Banking layouts, two standalone designs — their production
`preview_schema`, fetched read-only) and asserts on painted iframes and
bounding boxes: families visible and painted before any variant, the tray's
five layouts painted after one click, swatch repaint, one checked radio on
the followed selection, no sideways scroll at 1440×900 or 390×844
(`npm run test:e2e:report-template-picker`).

One environmental fact worth recording: a preview document's Google-Fonts
`@import` blocks a srcdoc iframe's **first paint** while the stylesheet is
pending, so an environment that black-holes `fonts.googleapis.com` shows
blank sheets until the connection dies — which is how this harness's first
screenshots came out, and why its fixtures strip `tokens.fontFaces` (the
fallback stacks are what a browser with no reach to the CDN uses anyway).
Production serves those fonts and the Library page demonstrably paints the
same previews.

### Verification

Picker unit suites rewritten and green (8 gallery tests, 14 selector tests —
one renegotiated wording pin); `templateRouteEnforcement.spec.ts` and the
adjacent template suites green; all five Chromium layout tests green; eslint
0 errors on every changed file (repo total holding at 44); style-token
ratchet holding; `check-src-missing-names` clean; production build; full
vitest suite green in one run — **1,077 files, 20,575 tests, 0 failures**. Production reads for fixtures and measurements were
read-only.

## 17 · Five client PDFs, six defects, one render (2026-09-04)

The owner attached five PDFs downloaded that morning — three reports of
1/27D Mitchell Street, Muswellbrook (a Compass, a Financial Analysis and a
derived Snapshot), rendered through Chancery and through the Luxury
Editorial "Frontispiece" chosen in the new picker — and named four
complaints: N/A everywhere, no table of contents anywhere, every report
titled Investment Compass whatever was chosen, and content cut off. All
four reproduced from the files, and the investigation found two more
underneath them that none of the four names: the silently dropped figures
(§1), and — visible only once those figures drew — the chart primitives
clipping their own labels (§6).

### 1 · Every figure the model composed was silently dropped

The stored Compass body carries **43 chart directives** — 13 glance strips,
6 bars, 6 donuts, 6 gauges, 4 timelines, a wheel, tiles, a heatmap, a
pictograph — and the rendered PDF contains **none of them**.
`markdownBlock.html.ts` called `renderMarkdown` without `renderDirective`,
and a shortcode is an instruction to the renderer either way, so every
directive was removed and drawn as nothing. The Disclaimer, whose whole
content is one glance strip, printed as a heading over nothing.

The block passes `vizDirectiveRenderer` now, in a `ChartContext` built from
the template's own tokens (keyword fallbacks, per the planning-context
convention), and `projectReportNarrative` charges the SAME directives
through `planningChartContext()` — `figureLines` reads the SVG's geometry
alone, so the page count and the buckets stay one arithmetic. The Compass
document grows from 13 truncated body pages to 23 complete ones.

### 2 · The tail printed over the running foot, silently

Page 19 of the Compass render ends mid-bullet — "Commercial Property Data
Providers (CoreLogic, Domain, realestate.com.au)" with its description
gone — and the footer beneath it is garbled where overflow text struck
through it. Measured: the final bucket packed **47 charged units under the
50 budget** and still overflowed the physical box, because the measured
charge model undercounts a bold-lead bullet list (a top-level item was
charged at the full measure, ignoring its own hanging indent) and page
margins. The estimator's error exceeded the 8% held back.

Two changes: measured list charging now subtracts the marker indent at
depth 0, and `CALIBRATED_CONT_LINES`/`CALIBRATED_FIRST_LINES` sit at
**46/36** (~16% under the bench capacity) — because a sparse page costs
white space and an overfull one costs a client the end of the document.
Re-packed against the real content: the failing bucket splits, the
Disclaimer and Notes get their own page, nothing touches the foot.

### 3 · N/A nineteen times, about figures the row held

The Snapshot's "The report" pages tabulate Median Price N/A, Grade N/A,
Score N/A/100, five component scores N/A, six financial rows N/A — while
the SAME ROW carries score 62, grade B and a complete
`financial_calculations` block. `condense-investment-report` hands the
model only the parent's PROSE — and a Compass parent deliberately states
no financials — then demands tables. The model, forced to fill a table
from a document that never says the numbers, wrote N/A.

`condenseFacts.pure.ts` renders the row through `projectInvestmentReport`
(the same reconciled projection every templated document binds) into an
authoritative RECORDED FIGURES block in the prompt, and the rule travels
with it: a metric absent from the record and the prose loses its ROW —
never gains a placeholder. The snapshot/financial guides' fixed metric
menus became choose-from lists under the same rule.

### 4 · Four document kinds, one name

Cover eyebrow, wordmark, running head and running foot were the literal
words "Investment Compass" in the Investment composer — and those masters
serve the compass, financial, snapshot, briefing AND strategic tiers. So a
Financial Analysis was titled Investment Compass on all 15 of its pages.
The composer binds `{{report.documentTitle}}` / `{{report.standfirst}}`
now, and `DOCUMENT_IDENTITY` in the projection is the one place a tier is
translated into words (Financial Analysis; Snapshot Report; Executive
Briefing; Strategic Overview; compass keeps its name and standfirst — and
an unrecognised tier reads as compass, the ranking's default document).

### 5 · Two whole families had no contents page

37 of the 50 Investment masters carry a Contents page; **Luxury Editorial
and Private Banking declare `toc_style: none` family-wide** — the house
default and the design the owner chose, which is why all five PDFs lack
one. `hasContents` returns true for every style now: navigability is a
property of the document, not of a family's styling, and `toc_style` keeps
deciding how the list is drawn, not whether the reader gets one.

### 6 · The chart primitives clipped their own labels

Fixing §1 made the figures visible, and the first honest render showed the
primitives cutting text: the score wheel printed "FUTURE RESILIENCE" as
"RE RESILIENCE" and lost GROWTH ALIGNMENT's tail; the bars' label column
clipped "Property-specific verification need" at the left edge; and the
risk matrix drew "5=High)" as an orphan row label floating under a one-row
grid.

The wheel taught the real lesson. `text()` converts points to viewBox
units through `w / widthMm`, so **widening the box also enlarges every
label in units** — a first fix added the label's estimated width to the
padding and the clip only moved ("TURE RESILIENCE"). Measured in Chromium
(`getComputedTextLength` over the failing labels): a 17-character tracked
uppercase micro label needs 140u of the 78u available at w=460, 161u of
114u at w=532, and would need w≈813 — wider than the wide box — on one
line. The fix is structural: long labels **wrap at the word break that
best balances two lines** (never truncated — a shortened dimension name is
a different dimension), the width is the closed-form solution of
`w/2 − labelR ≥ label(w) + edge` (solvable because label(w) is linear in
w), and the label/value blocks stack radially outward with leads computed
from the type's own unit size, growing the box height from the actual
extents. The advance is measured, not guessed: 0.71em per uppercase
character, 0.55em mixed-case, carried with margin.

The same honesty went to the other two. The bars and matrix label columns
size from `ptToUnits(micro) × 0.58` instead of a 5.4-unit guess (three
characters short on the real 26-character row label); the matrix solves
its width as a converged fixed point, refuses — the module's own rule —
when labels at micro size are physically wider than the measure and no
box width can fit them, and scales its header band and cell height with
the type. And the orphan label was the directive parser: `csv()` split
`rows=Risk level (1=Low, 5=High)` on the comma inside the parenthesis,
declaring a second row the grid never had — it now splits only on commas
outside parentheses (the quote-aware splitter's rule, extended), and
`renderHeatmap` refuses to draw a label for a row or column the grid does
not hold, because a labelled row is a promise that figures follow.

### Shipping the fix to documents people already generate

Master schemas are COPIES — seeded and adopted rows never updated — so the
v10 seed alone would fix only future adoptions. Two migrations ship
together: `20260917100000` reseeds the library (543 templates revalidated),
and `20260917110000` refreshes every ACTIVE `report_templates` row that
descends from a listed design: the entry's new schema with THE ROW'S OWN
token colours carried forward (a colourway bake is exactly that merge, so
no palette is invented), and the lineage's entryVersion advanced so the
picker's fold keeps recognising the copy. Rows with no lineage are
untouched.

### Verified against the failing documents themselves

Both real reports were re-rendered through the updated Luxury Editorial
master with the real projection in Chromium: the Financial Analysis covers
itself as FINANCIAL ANALYSIS with its own standfirst; both carry Contents
as page 2; the wheel, donuts, glance strips and gauges draw in the family
palette; and both tails — the exact sentences missing from the shipped
PDFs — sit whole on their pages. Every chart-bearing page was then
screenshot and read: all five wheel labels whole (wrapped, values clear of
the disc), the three DD-focus bar labels whole, and the risk matrix one
labelled row with six labelled columns. `reportRenderDefects.spec.ts` pins
all six fixes; `narrativeCalibration.spec.ts`, `vizDirectives.spec.ts` and
`vizFigures.spec.ts` hold.

## 18 · Coverage of the choice, and the cascade into every format (2026-09-04)

The owner attached a real 15-page Property Comparison and asked two things:
that the visual template choice reach **every** area that produces a report
or downloadable document, and that §17's rectifications (Contents pages and
the rest) demonstrably cascade beyond the Investment format. Both were
measured before anything was changed.

### The choice — 40 exits swept, three gaps, one lawful absence

Every document exit in `src/` was inventoried: forty inside the report-format
system and twenty-three deliberately outside it (AML records, agreement
templates, portal file downloads — each governed by its own rules, none a
candidate for a template choice). Coverage was already strong: the primary
exits of nine formats carry `useReportTemplateMenu` or an inline
`ReportTemplateSelector`, and `templateDocument.ts` honours the stored
selection at delivery with the `unavailable` guard. Three Investment exits
did not — the Generated Reports **viewer**, the listings **modal** and the
client-property **download sheet** all delivered through the unified
template-first road while offering no way to see or change which template
the document comes out in. Each now mounts the selector where the export
panel precedent puts it: before the buttons that use it. The Cash Flow
Comparison's absence is correct, not a gap — the format is preview-only
because nothing about a comparison is persisted anywhere a template can
read, and the menu hook already returns nothing for a format a choice
cannot change. Legacy jsPDF paths are outside selection by definition: they
ARE the named legacy layout.

### The cascade — one real comparison, eight defects, three of them global

The attached PDF (three properties, NSW) reproduced a defect family §17's
fixes had not reached, because every §17 measurement was taken on the
Investment format:

1. **Parts jumped 12 → 19.** Part numbers were baked at compose time
   (`partNo += 1`), so every page a `conditional` dropped left a hole in the
   numbering of the document that shipped. Part numbers now resolve at
   render time: the renderer counts `{{partNumber}}`-binding pages over the
   pages that actually draw (the binding is also the opt-in, so the cover
   stays outside the count), `pad2` keeps the "Part 07" style, and the same
   per-page value serves the running head and the section numeral so the two
   cannot disagree. All six composers that number parts converted
   (`renderTimePart` in `blocks.ts`); the count is folded into the page
   cache signature because a page's number depends on which preceding pages
   opted in.
2. **Empty ruled stripes under labels.** The scorecard drew two blank zebra
   rows for axes the record does not hold, and three of six "Basis of the
   analysis" rows printed as label-over-nothing. `data-table` rows already
   had the answer — an explicit per-row `when`, added for exactly this rule —
   so `definition-list` items gained the same (`renderDefinitionListHtml`
   filters, a list whose every item is absent draws nothing), and the
   comparison composer declares the conditions on every fixed slot.
3. **Whole pages of furniture over nothing.** The "Money · cash flow" page
   rendered a heading and zero rows; "Who each property is for" rendered a
   heading and nothing at all (its continuation page was conditional, the
   first page was not). The axis-reason pages are now conditional on holding
   at least one slot, and the first investor-fit page on `matches[0]`.
4. **A callout that asked its own question and left it blank.** "Why there
   is no recommendation here" bound `comparison.truncationNote`, which was
   composed only for salvaged rows — the attached row is structured and
   complete, merely without a structured `bestOverall`, so the heading drew
   over an empty body. The projection now composes the note whenever the
   pick is absent, whatever the cause, in the format's own sentences.
5. **"Eleven axes, side by side"** was a hardcoded count over a
   data-dependent table showing eight. The heading is count-free; with row
   suppression the table describes itself.

The Contents-page cascade needed no new work — every format's composer gates
its Contents on the same `hasContents` §17 made unconditionally true — but
it was verified rather than trusted: the fixture comparison renders 14 pages
with Contents as Part 01 and parts 01–12 consecutive, the empty pages gone,
the basis list three honest rows, and the verdict callout answered. A
converted Borrowing Capacity master renders gap-free under sample data with
no unresolved `{{partNumber}}`.

Shipping is the §17 pattern: the v11 seed (543 templates revalidated) plus
`20260918100000_refresh_active_masters_from_library_v11.sql`, which
re-copies every active library-descended row with its own baked colourway
carried forward. `reportCoverageCascade.spec.ts` pins the renderer count,
the filter, the item `when`, the projection note, the composer conditionals,
the three selector mounts and the migration pair; the four catalogue specs
that assert "bind nothing the projection cannot publish" now name
`partNumber` as renderer-ambient, beside `pageNumber`.

## 19 · Phase 1 of the tier framework — derived reports read the record (2026-09-05)

The signed-off framework (`docs/reports/TIER_FRAMEWORK.md`, and the audit that
preceded it) reduced every derived-tier defect to one cause: prose was the only
carrier of substance, and the Compass — the only parent — stopped carrying
financial prose in v3.0. Phase 1 makes the record the carrier. All figures
below were measured on the 4 September production family of 1/27D Mitchell
Street (parent `0478c410`, children `c21ed1fa`/`2f1f7f6f`/`89b451f6`/
`8c6edc56`) before and after, re-composed through the same modules the
functions now run.

**The Financial fork composes its chapters from `financial_calculations`.**
The "Client Investment Feasibility & Financial Performance Report" was a
substring routing of a parent with no financial sections to route: 7 headings,
ONE dollar sign, while its own row held seven key metrics, eleven annual-cost
lines, ten loan details, three projection scenarios and a sensitivity grid.
`reports/investment/financialChapters.pure.ts` writes the missing chapters —
purchase & holding costs, rental & yield, loan structure, sensitivity, the
ten-year table (with equity and LVR, which the stored series already carried),
the scorecard and the SWOT — from `reconcileStoredFinancials(...)`'s healed
record, the same heal the KPI tiles bind, so a chapter and a tile cannot
disagree. Composed chapters REPLACE routed prose claiming the same FIN ordinal
or heading (the record wins over a legacy parent's stale tables), and the
response names what was replaced. After: **14 headings, 109 dollar signs,
0 N/A**, and the document reads as the declared FIN structure.

**The Briefing's guide is cut to the parent that exists.** It still described
the 17-section legacy Compass — eight financial tables and a market-performance
grid demanded from a parent forbidden to carry them, which the model filled
with N/A: 33.2 per briefing before August, 87 on the newest. The guide now asks
the model only for the condensed location case; the financial tables, score
breakdown and SWOT are composed server-side after the call (`composed_sections`
in the response), and the SWOT is typed from the score record's own four lists
rather than improvised.

**A labelled row is a promise — enforced on stored markdown.**
`derivedHygiene.pure.ts#stripPlaceholderRows` drops a table row whose first
value cell is a placeholder, blanks trailing placeholder cells, drops tables
left with no body, and drops placeholder-confession lines ("- Source
attribution: N/A (…)"). Run over the worst production briefing it removed 39
rows, 11 tables, 5 lines and blanked 15 cells — **87 → 0**. It runs on every
fork and condense output, alongside `stripEditorialLabelsFromMarkdown` (the
label strip alone, exported from the post-processor — the full pass's word
caps are the Compass's and must not touch other tiers' sections).

**The Snapshot is one document again.** The newest snapshot carried its 8
declared sections and then the parent's 9 echoed back — 17 headings, 2.5× the
format's length, and nothing post-processed it (hygiene ran on the briefing
alone, which was exactly backwards). `trimToDeclaredSections` keeps what the
tier declares and names what it dropped; the guide now says so to the model
too. Measured: 17 → 9 headings, 12,325 → ~3,000 chars, 17 → 11 rendered pages.

**The Due Diligence scorer can score, and the verdict sentence can no longer
print holes.** `scorePropertyFundamentals` counted `dDemand` twice (as demand
AND "tenant fit") against a three-of-five floor, so a row without both real
dimensions never scored — `investment_score` was null on 11 of 11 strategic
rows and the verdict page printed "Graded  at  out of 100" with the holes
left in. Four honest dimensions now, floor stated in place (≥2 available, at
least one of location/demand), weights rebalanced 40/35/15/10. The fork falls
back to the parent's composite score when the variant scorer cannot compute
(a refresh never overwrites a good score with null) and carries the parent's
strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/risks onto variant scores, whose engine
leaves them empty. And the sentence itself is COMPOSED: the projection
publishes `recommendation.gradedLine`/`gradedDetailLine` only when grade and
score exist, with a weighting clause naming the dimensions THIS score carries
(`scoreSections.pure.ts`); the two verdict bodies bind it (template library
v12 + active-master refresh). Measured: the strategic child renders "Graded
C+ at 53 out of 100, weighted across location and planning risk." where it
rendered holes.

**Lineage is stamped.** `fork-investment-report` never wrote
`generation_engine`, so every child took the column default `legacy` —
including the four forked from a compass-40 parent — and never carried
`report_scope` at all. Both engines now stamp the parent's engine; the fork
carries scope.

Pinned by `tierFrameworkPhase1.spec.ts` (19 tests: composition, hygiene,
scorer, sentence, source-scans of both functions, the v12 migration pair).
Bridges keep the new pure modules inside the investment format's closed
import set; `condenseFacts` now shares `figures.pure.ts` with the composer so
one thousands-separator serves both.

---

## §20 — Phase 2: one registry, and what it found

Law 3 of the tier framework: *one registry is the constitution — structure is
selected by section id, never by matching heading strings, and a declared
section with no producer fails CI.* Shipped as
`_shared/reports/investment/sectionRegistry.pure.ts` plus
`sectionRegistry.spec.ts`, measured against the 1,199-row corpus on 6 September
2026.

### There were six competing structure definitions, not four

| # | Where | Shape | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `generate-investment-report` `DEFAULT_REPORT_SECTIONS` (+3 scope variants) | 12 groups naming 26 H2s | the generator's prompt |
| 2 | `compassSectionRegistry.ts` | 12 `compass.*` + 11 `financial.*` ids | post-processor, QA validator, generator |
| 3 | `reportSplitRegistry.ts` | FIN 16 / PLDD 17, routed by heading substring | `fork-investment-report` |
| 4 | `condense-investment-report` `TIER_CONFIG[*].sections` | briefing 9, snapshot 6, financial 11 | **nothing** |
| 5 | the `structureGuide` prose in the same object | the headings a model is asked for | the model |
| 6 | an inline array at the snapshot's trim call site | 9 headings | `trimToDeclaredSections` |

Two more key on structure without declaring it: `PROSE_GROUPS`
(`sections.pure.ts`) groups by section **number**, and `TITLED_SECTION_CHARTS`
(`normalise.pure.ts`) attaches charts by title regex.

### What the corpus said about the declarations

**#4 was read by nothing, and the snapshot's copy was wrong.** Only `.name`,
`.targetPages` and `.structureGuide` are ever read. The dead snapshot list named
`Top Opportunities & Risks` and `Recommendation`; the guide beside it in the same
object literal asks for `Top 3 Opportunities`, `Top 3 Risks` and `Quick
Recommendation`, and for two more headings the dead list omits entirely. Six
declared entries against nine real ones. `contentRatio` was likewise never read.

**FIN declares 16 sections and two have never been produced.** Across all 11
financial forks ever made: `10-Year Cashflow, Equity & Growth Projection` **0**,
`Financial Investment Scorecard` **0**; ordinals 6, 10 and 13 appear on one
report each; 4, 5, 8 and 14 on two. Meanwhile `Disclaimer` — which FIN does not
declare — is on 11 of 11, because `renderVariantMarkdown` appends it
unconditionally.

**PLDD declares 17 and six consecutive ones appear on 1 of 11.** Ordinals 11–16
— tenant demand, resale appeal, **planning/zoning/title**, infrastructure,
environmental risk (2), supply pipeline — on the tier whose entire promise is due
diligence. Nothing measured this, because a list of strings cannot be asked
whether anything makes them.

**The compass-40 engine produced three different structures in five runs.** Two
rows carry exactly the 11 declared `includeInCompass` sections; two carry a v2.0
set of 17–18; one carries a hybrid with the **unmerged** v2.0 sections
(`Population & Housing Demand`, `Tenant & Buyer Profile`, `Employment & Economic
Linkages`, `Education & Family Amenity`, `Retail, Healthcare & Lifestyle
Amenity`, `Transport & Connectivity`) plus `Cover Page` and `Client Reading
Guide`, both of which the registry marks `includeInCompass: false`. The v3.0
merges existed only as a code comment.

**`PROSE_GROUPS` keys on numbers no recent report has.** Compass primary reports
in the last 90 days: 29, **0 numbered**. Older: 1,098, of which 144 (13.1%) are.

### The registry

38 sections, each carrying its provenance class, the headings production has
actually carried for it, and a placement per tier: depth, order, label, surface
and producer. It is the **union** of what every tier draws, because the tiers
disagree about granularity — Due Diligence splits demand across four headings and
risk across two where the Compass draws one of each — and a registry with only
the coarse ids cannot emit PLDD's list while one with only the fine ids cannot
emit the Compass's. `depth: 'merged'` with `mergedInto` carries the difference.

`sectionRegistry.spec.ts` (136 tests) resolves every producer by running it: a
composed ordinal must actually come out of `composeFinancialChapters` on a full
record, an authored section must be named in the prompt that asks for it, a
routed one must exist at that ordinal in the split registry, and a projection
namespace must be one `applyInvestmentProjection` really merges. It then asserts
FIN, PLDD and the Compass registry are each expressible as registry placements at
the same headings, so the three can drift only by failing CI.

That test earned its place immediately: the first draft of the registry named two
projection namespaces — `keyFigures.*` and `sources.*` — that do not exist.

### Two findings the producibility check surfaced, and the fixes

**The Briefing had no trim, and 21 of 21 carry the parent's structure.** Phase 1
re-cut the guide and shipped no enforcement; the snapshot got both halves and the
briefing got one. Of its nine declared headings, `Top 3 Opportunities` and `Top 3
Risks` appear on 16 reports, `Executive Summary` on **1**, and `Location &
Demand`, `Amenity & Access`, `Market Position`, `Property Fit`, `Risk Overview`
and `Recommendation` on **none** — while `Location Overview` is on 20 and
`Historical Price Growth Table` on 19. Both condensed tiers are now trimmed to
`markdownHeadingsForTier(tier)`, which returns the authored and composed headings
together — the reason the list has to come from the registry rather than from
either call site. Run against production row `89b451f6`, the trim keeps 5 of 29
headings and drops 24.

**`provenance` is spine and the Briefing had no producer for it.** The re-cut
guide never asks for a sources section, so a client's briefing would carry no
statement of what it rests on. `## Market Data Sources` is now in the guide,
worded so the section is never omitted and never filled with a placeholder.

**The trim will not empty a document.** If no *authored* heading survives, the
untrimmed text is kept and `sections_trim_skipped` recorded. The guard asks about
authored headings specifically because the composed chapters are appended by us
and always match — "something survived" would be satisfied by our own output and
say nothing about whether the model followed the guide.

### What Phase 2 deliberately did not do

Nothing routes on the registry yet. `reportSplitRegistry` still owns the fork's
substring routing and `compassSectionRegistry` still owns the generator's prompt;
both are now pinned to the registry rather than replaced by it. **A producer that
resolves is not a section that appears** — the Due Diligence tier's routed
producers are all correct and still put planning on 1 of 11 documents, because
routing depends on the parent carrying a matchable heading and the Compass parent
carries its planning content merged inside Risk Dashboard. That is law 4's
problem, and Phase 3 fixes it by assembling from stored sections rather than
re-reading a sibling document.

Pinned by `sectionRegistry.spec.ts` (136) and `tierRegistryAdoption.spec.ts` (11).

## §21 — Phase 3, part 1: can the registry recognise what production wrote?

Phase 3 assembles documents from the registry instead of by matching heading
strings. Before any of that could be designed, one number had to be measured:
**how much of the corpus does the registry actually recognise?** If assembly by
id cannot name a heading, that heading's content is lost.

### The measurement

Every `##` heading in the 1,199 stored reports: **966 distinct headings, 10,752
instances** — for a product with 38 sections.

| resolver | headings | instances |
|---|---|---|
| as Phase 2 shipped it | 278/966 (28.8%) | 6,529/10,752 (60.7%) |
| + multi-level ordinal fix | 295 (30.5%) | 6,898 (64.2%) |
| + qualified variants | 400 (41.4%) | 7,330 (68.2%) |
| + six section aliases (final) | — | **73.3%** on the committed fixture |

### The 966:38 ratio is the finding

The residue is not a set of sections the registry forgot. It is:

- **sub-headings the legacy generator promotes to H2** — `Strengths`,
  `Weaknesses`, `Opportunities`, `Threats` under SWOT; `Market Commentary:`,
  `Yield Commentary:`, `Loan Assumptions:` under their sections; the whole
  `11.1 …` / `15.1 …` / `4.2 …` family;
- **furniture that is not a section at all** — `📞 CONTACT US`, on 761 reports.

That decides the design. A partition that dropped what it could not name would
discard nearly a third of every legacy document; one that treated each
unrecognised heading as a section would fragment one SWOT into four. So:

> **An unrecognised heading is content belonging to the section above it. Never
> a section, never a deletion.**

`partitionByRegistry` implements it, and reports what it absorbed so a genuinely
new heading is visible rather than silently swallowed.

### Three rules that fell out of the measurement

**A sub-heading must not be an alias.** Adding `Strengths` to the alias table
would make it *open* a section, splitting SWOT into four. The absorb rule puts
it exactly where it belongs and costs nothing — so an alias is only ever a
heading a document uses as a section.

**Numbering outranks text.** `11.1 Public Transport Network` reduces to `public
transport network`, a genuine alias of `transport` — and opening a section there
cuts section 11 in half at its own sub-heading. The legacy generator numbers
top-level sections `1.` … `13.` and sub-sections `11.1`, `15.1`, `4.2`, so
`isSubHeadingByNumbering` treats two or more levels as a sub-heading whatever
the words say.

**A section id may repeat, and repeats are kept in order.** Production briefing
`89b451f6` carries 29 headings resolving to 21 sections, with `marketPosition`
four times and `tenYear` three. Collapsing them in the reader would merge bodies
written apart and reorder a client's document; how to fold them belongs to the
storage step, not to the text splitter.

### Two defects fixed

`normaliseHeading` required trailing punctuation after an ordinal
(`\d+(\.\d+)*[.)]`), so `9. Financial Analysis` normalised and `11.1 Public
Transport Network` did not — worth **3.5 points** of instance coverage. The
obvious fix, making the punctuation optional, overshoots: it would strip the
leading number of a real name, turning `2026 Market Review` into `market
review`. The rule shipped instead is that an ordinal is EITHER multi-level
(`11.1 `) OR punctuated (`9. `), never a bare number and a space. No corpus
heading has that shape today, which is the moment to close it rather than after
one arrives.

Qualified variants did not resolve at all — `Property Value Projections (AUD)`,
`Cashflow Analysis - Interest-Only Scenario (Year 1)`, `Education Facilities
(Extended List)`. Worth **4.0 points**. The separator must be a bracket, dash or
colon and never a bare space, or `Market Position` would swallow `Market
Positioning`.

### Verified against real documents

Four production documents spanning both engines and three tiers — 39.6k, 48.4k,
14.4k and 51.6k characters — partition with their non-whitespace content
**conserved exactly**. The compass-40 document resolves to precisely its 11
declared sections; the legacy Compass to 11 plus one absorbed heading (its own
title, correctly left in the preamble).

`fixtures/corpusHeadings.json` is the committed heading inventory: every heading
carried by two or more reports, scrubbed of the twelve singletons that named a
property address. It makes coverage a CI number rather than a one-off
measurement — a regression shows up as a failing floor instead of a quietly
thinner report.

Pinned by `corpusPartition.spec.ts` (21).

## §22 — What the record does not hold

Phase 3's next step was per-section storage. Measuring what could actually be
stored found something that changes the programme's priorities, so it is
recorded before any of that is built.

### The Due Diligence tier's defining section cannot be produced at all

`Planning, Zoning and Title Due Diligence` appears on **1 of the 11** Due
Diligence reports ever produced. Neither available producer can fix it:

- **Routing cannot.** The Compass parent folds planning into Risk Dashboard —
  the registry states this — so there is no section in the parent to route.
- **Composition cannot.** The record holds no planning data. Across all 1,199
  stored reports, `property_specs` carries a `zoning` key on 1,071 and a zoning
  **value on zero**; `location_intelligence`, present on 1,112, holds only
  `amenities`, `commute`, `coordinates`, `healthcare`, `lifestyle`, `schools`,
  `transport` and `walkScore` — no planning, zoning, overlay, title or
  environmental key at all.

Nor is it a wiring fault: no table in the schema carries residential zoning,
land size or council area. `zoning` exists only on `commercial_properties` and
`industrial_properties`, a different product. **The platform does not acquire
this data**, so the fix is upstream of the reporting engine.

It is now a declared gap (`PRODUCER_GAPS = ['strategic:planning']`) rather than
a placement claiming a producer that cannot produce. The tier keeps its promise
and the registry stops asserting something it cannot honour.

### Six of nine property attributes have never held a value

`property_specs`, measured over all 1,199 reports:

| attribute | reports with a value | | attribute | reports with a value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `property_type` | 1,071 | | `parking` | **0** |
| `bedrooms` | 651 | | `year_built` | **0** |
| `bathrooms` | 633 | | `building_size_sqm` | **0** |
| | | | `land_size_sqm` | **0** |
| | | | `council_area` | **0** |
| | | | `zoning` | **0** |

`reportBindingProjection` publishes all nine. So `property.landArea`,
`property.buildingArea`, `property.yearBuilt`, `property.zoning` and
`property.council` resolve to nothing on every document the product has ever
issued, and `configuration` renders without a car count because parking is
always absent.

**`propertyIdentity` is a spine section** — mandatory in every tier — and it is
substantially empty on every report. Law 2 says a labelled row is a promise that
a figure follows it; this is that law failing at the data layer rather than the
rendering one, which is why no amount of template or assembly work reaches it.

### And the financial model is thinner than it looks

`financial_calculations` is present on **202 of 1,199** reports (17%). Every
composed financial chapter — the Phase 1 work — is bounded by that. It is
correct on the rows that have a calculation and silently absent on the rest,
which is the designed behaviour, but it means the Financial tier's substance
exists for fewer than a fifth of the corpus.

### What this means for Phase 3

Per-section storage and assembly by id remain worth building, and they fix the
routing weaknesses. They cannot fix a section whose source data does not exist.
The registry now says which is which, so the next increment can build assembly
for the sections that can be assembled without implying the others are one
refactor away.

---

## §23 — The coordinate every location figure is measured from (2026-09-06)

Phase 3's measurement of what the record holds (§22) asked what is *absent*.
This asks a harder question about what is *present*: is the stored figure the
right one? For the location section the answer is available, because every
property in this corpus is in Australia and a coordinate outside it is not an
unusual property — it is a wrong answer.

### The measurement

Of the 1,112 stored investment reports carrying
`location_intelligence.coordinates`:

| | reports | share |
|---|---:|---:|
| inside the Australian bounding box | 929 | 83.5% |
| **outside Australia** | **183** | **16.5%** |
| **exactly Sydney CBD (−33.8688, 151.2093), to four decimals** | **64** | **5.8%** |

Sydney CBD to four decimals is not a coincidence; it was this service's
hard-coded failure value. Together, **247 of 1,112 reports — 22% — carry a
coordinate that is either not in Australia or is the geocoder's way of saying
it gave up.**

The twelve most-repeated foreign points, with the address that produced each:

| address as stored | resolved to | reports |
|---|---|---:|
| `Keystone Drive` | Blacksburg, Virginia | 8 |
| `124 First Avenue` | Manhattan, New York | 7 |
| `Walbrook Drive` | Knoxville, Tennessee | 7 |
| `Prophets Street` | Bulacan, Philippines | 7 |
| `590 Walker Street` | Manhattan, New York | 7 |
| `40 Avondale Road` | Auckland, New Zealand | 6 |
| `84-85 Pacific Boulevard` | Long Island, New York | 6 |
| `4 Lilac Close` | Bristol, England | 5 |
| `44 Frederick Street` | Edinburgh, Scotland | 5 |
| `63 Lakeview Drive` | North Carolina | 5 |
| `7 Kinghorn Street` | City of London | 4 |
| `25 Acacia Avenue` | Ottawa, Canada | 4 |

### Why this was invisible

Every figure in a report's location section — the amenity counts, the nearest
school and its rating, the walk score, the CBD commute — is measured *from the
coordinate*, by real Google Places and Distance Matrix calls that succeed. A
wrong coordinate does not make them fail. It makes them describe somewhere
else, accurately. A report for a property in Perth carrying Sydney's schools
and Sydney's walk score contains no error a reader can see, no `N/A`, and
nothing the placeholder scrub or the fact-checker can catch: the numbers are
real, they are just about a different place. This is the same failure class as
`cotality-scoping.md`'s note on score clustering, and it is the reason that
note existed.

### Four faults, each sufficient on its own

**1 · The question had no locality.** The service is handed `suburb`,
`postcode` and `state`, and spent them on the CBD lookup and the
public-transport call. The one request that actually needed a locality — the
geocode — was given `input.address` alone. Split by what the address itself
said:

| the address names… | reports | landed outside Australia |
|---|---:|---:|
| a state **and** a postcode | 283 | **1** (0.4%) |
| neither | 768 | **180** (23.4%) |

That is the cause. A bare street name exists in every English-speaking
country, and Google was not malfunctioning — it was asked an ambiguous
question and returned one of its correct answers.

**2 · No country filter.** `components=country:AU` is a filter;
`region=au` is only a bias, and the request carried neither.

**3 · Nothing checked the answer.** `auGeoSanity.pure.ts` — country box, land
mask, state cross-check — already existed and is already applied by
`resolve-listing-coordinates`. This geocoder did not ask it.

**4 · Failure returned Sydney CBD.** Not an error, not a null: a coordinate,
indistinguishable downstream from a real one.

Faults 1 and 2 are not alternatives, which is the trap here. The country
filter *alone* only relocates the error: `Keystone Drive` restricted to
Australia resolves to some Keystone Drive here, in the wrong suburb, inside
the country box, past every gate. Composing the query is what makes the answer
right rather than merely local.

### What changed

- `_shared/auGeocodeQuery.pure.ts` composes the query from the parts the
  service already holds, never repeating one the address already spells.
- The request now sends `components=country:AU` **and** `region=au`.
- The answer goes through `assessAuPoint` — the shared gate, not a second
  bounding box written beside it.
- An unresolved address returns `success: false, resolved: false` with a
  reason, **not** the sample-data branch: sample data is a fact about no
  property, an unresolvable address is a fact about this one, and a caller
  must be able to tell them apart.
- A caller-*supplied* coordinate goes through the same gate, because the
  stored rows are where the 183 live and handing one back is the door a fix on
  the fetch path alone would leave open.

Both report consumers already guard on `success && data`, so a refusal lands
them in the path they take when the service is unreachable:
`enhancedData.locationIntelligence` stays undefined, where the existing
coverage flag records it.

### The trade this makes, stated plainly

A refused geocode means the location section is **absent** rather than wrong.
That is the intended direction — a reader can see an absent section and cannot
see a correct-looking figure measured from the wrong continent — but it is a
real cost and the expected volume is small: the 283 addresses that already
name a state and a postcode geocoded correctly 282 times, and the 768 that
name neither will now be asked *with* their locality rather than without it.
The expected outcome for most of the 183 is a **correct** coordinate, not an
absent one.

### Two things deliberately not done here

**No backfill.** The 247 stored rows are untouched; nothing is re-geocoded and
no vendor call is spent. Fixing forward stops the fault reproducing; repairing
the record is a separate, authorised decision.

**`generateMockLocationData` is untouched and remains a live defect.** It is
reachable on three branches — no API key, a Google API error, and the
top-level catch — and each returns **HTTP 200 with `success: true`** carrying
invented school names (`Primary School A`, `High School B`,
`Private College C`), an invented `Central Station`, a random walk score
(`Math.random()`), a random commute, and Sydney's coordinates. Exactly one
consumer inspects `usingMockData`, and it only `console.warn`s while using the
data anyway; `regenerate-report-qualitative` does not check it at all. That is
a larger behaviour change than the one made here and is recorded rather than
taken unilaterally.

---

## §24 — The invented data behind the reports (2026-09-06)

§23 found one fabricator (`generateMockLocationData`) while fixing the
geocoder. Sweeping for the class found **seven of the nine external-data
services** behind report generation answering "I don't know" by inventing —
and every one of them reported as normal operation, which is why the class
survived the platform's whole life. This section is the record of what was
measured, what was removed, and what now guards the door.

### The measurements, service by service

**`abs-data-service` — the worst of them.** It never called the ABS at all:
its four live-API functions (`fetchPopulationData`, `fetchIncomeData`,
`fetchHousingData`, `fetchEmploymentData`) had **no caller anywhere**. Every
request was answered by one of THREE invented profiles for the whole of
Australia (eleven named postcodes were "high-income metro"; NT/TAS/SA were
"regional"; everywhere else "standard suburban") with `Math.random()` jitter
on population, density, income, age and rent, labelled
`source: 'ABS Census 2021 estimates'` — then **cached for 30 days and served
back as `'ABS Census Cache'`**, the fabrication laundering itself into a
cache hit, while `api_health_log` recorded a successful `abs-census` call
that was never made. In production:

- **849 of 1,199 stored reports, across 500 distinct properties, carry the
  identical profile**: growth 2.5%, unemployment 3.5%, owner-occupiers
  69.8%, participation 68.4% — every suburb in the country, the same suburb.
- `10 Chester Street` holds **20 reports with 20 different populations**
  (16,245 → 38,773), median income $99,003 → $141,343, rent $520 → $689.
  Regenerating a report re-rolled the demographics.

**`public-transport-service`.** Eight per-state "fetchers" that ignored the
coordinate entirely: every NSW property was 450m from Central Station with
lines T1–T8; every VIC property 250m from a Swanston Street tram; every
state a hard-coded landmark list with an invented `qualityScore` — which
drove up to 30 points of every report's walk score through
location-intelligence, overriding Google's real, coordinate-measured transit
results. Its error path invented a *different* answer ("Unknown", 999m,
score 25).

**`abs-employment-service`.** A labour-force size of
`15000 * (0.5 + Math.random() * 0.5)` — a random number of workers —
hard-coded tables for five states (TAS, NT and the ACT silently received
NSW's figures), canned job growth (`+2.8%` annual, everywhere), a fixed
occupation breakdown, and a canned `futureOutlook: 'Positive'` paragraph for
every suburb in the country, all under `dataSource: 'Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS)'`, `dataset: '6202.0 - Labour Force, Australia'`.

**`crime-statistics-service`.** Postcode bands invented **counts of
offences** ("Break and Enter: N"), a safety score, and "22% higher than
state average" — a comparison against a statistic nobody computed. Its
per-state fetchers did call the open-data catalogues, then discarded the
response at a `// TODO` and fell through to the invention. An invented crime
figure defames a suburb or falsely reassures a buyer; either way it is
libel-shaped.

**`climate-data-service`.** One climate per state — every property in NSW
shared one annual rainfall (1,150mm) from Bourke to Bondi — cached **365
days**. Its own comment conceded there was no source ("BoM's open data
delivery is currently suspended … We'll use climate zone patterns").

**`abs-seifa-service`.** Real attempts against the ABS API and data.gov.au,
then a fallback that assigned socio-economic deciles from postcode folklore
("Eastern suburbs decile 10, Western Sydney decile 4") with scores derived
as `900 + decile × 10` and the sibling indexes as ±constants.

**`school-data-service`.** Real directory + real Google Places, then a final
fallback that invented **named institutions** — `"${suburb} Public School"`,
ICSEA guessed from a postcode list, 450 students — schools that do not
exist, in a client's report.

**`rba-data-service`.** A real live path (domain-filtered search over
rba.gov.au/abs.gov.au, temperature 0, range-validated, cited). But all four
failure exits returned a cash rate **hard-coded at 4.10%** and stamped with
**today's date** — over a year stale at removal, presented as current, with
an `isFallback: true` flag that nothing anywhere read.

**`risk-assessment-service`.** The most real of the nine — AFRIP flood
queries and actual state bushfire-mapping services. But its fallbacks
invented: any suburb whose *name* contained "hills", "ranges" or "forest"
was rated **Extreme** bushfire risk (Baulkham Hills and Surry Hills alike);
fifteen suburb-name fragments decided flood risk by substring (anything
containing "kew" inherited Maribyrnong's flood history); and an outage was
cached for 180 days.

**The caches, in total:** `abs_census_cache` 123 rows, `climate_data_cache`
1,237, `crime_statistics_cache` 140, `transport_data_cache` 639 — **2,139
rows, 100% `data_quality = 'estimated'`, zero live**. No real fetch ever
completed in any of the four. (`risk_assessment_cache`: 169 rows, 100%
live — AFRIP is real.)

**The clean counter-example:** `domain-data-service`. Real API; on failure,
`success: false` with a status-only `fallbackData` carrying no figures. The
pattern existed in-repo the whole time.

### The rule, and what changed

**A source that cannot answer says so.** A missing section is a visible
absence a reader can weigh; an invented one is a defect nobody can detect,
because every downstream figure is computed from it correctly. This is the
same asymmetry the AML programme records as "refusal is visible, a confident
clear against nothing is not".

- **`_shared/sourceUnavailable.pure.ts`** is the one honest answer:
  `{ success: false, data: null, unavailable: true, service, reason,
  message }` at HTTP 200, with four reasons that each name a different
  remedy (`not_configured`, `provider_error`, `source_not_integrated`,
  `no_data_for_location`). No field on it can carry a figure.
- Every generator is **deleted, not bypassed** — a dormant generator is one
  code path away from coming back (the agreements programme's rule). The
  real paths (AFRIP, state bushfire mapping, schools directory, Google
  Places, Domain, the RBA live retrieval, the two SEIFA attempts) are
  untouched.
- Both report pipelines already attach data only on `success && data`
  (verified at every call site; no `fetchServiceWithFallback` caller passes
  a fallback value), so a refusal lands in the exact path taken when a
  service is unreachable, and the existing coverage flags record it.
- Public-transport's consumer needed one guard: that service historically
  returned a **bare** payload, so the envelope would have read as data —
  `isSourceUnavailable()` in location-intelligence keeps the refusal from
  outranking Google's real transit results.
- Risk-assessment keeps its composite shape (a real flood reading can stand
  beside an unavailable bushfire one): its fallbacks now return `level:
  'Unknown'` with the reason and the official source, and **an outage is
  never cached**.
- Migration `20261112020000` purges the 2,139 fabricated cache rows —
  filtered on `data_quality = 'estimated'` so anything a real integration
  writes survives — and `abs-data-service` reads its cache `live`-only, so a
  straggler row from a not-yet-redeployed old revision cannot be served
  either.
- `api_health_log` is no longer told a story: nothing logs a successful
  call that was never made.

### What guards the door

`scripts/security/check-fabricated-data.mjs`, wired into `ci.yml` and
`security:test` (gate 56; the gates-wired check counts it):

1. A **`Math.random()` ratchet** over `supabase/functions/` — every
   occurrence must be named in
   `supabase/functions-registry/math-random-allowlist.json` with a reviewed
   purpose (jitter, ids, SVG handles); counts may only fall. Comments are
   stripped first, because the removal deliberately left the history in
   comments.
2. The ten de-fabricated services must keep their honest-absence contract
   and must not reintroduce any generator by name.

The negative-test harness proves the gate bites: a mutation reintroducing
`getMockABSData(` fails it (38 controls removed → 38 gates failed).
`src/lib/reports/__tests__/fabricatedDataRemoval.spec.ts` pins the same
contracts in the verify job, plus the consumer guards and the purge
migration's shape.

### What this costs, and what fills the hole

New reports will carry **absent** demographics, employment, climate, crime,
SEIFA and transport-detail sections until real integrations exist, and
that is the point: the sections were never real. The acquisition paths are
recorded at the head of each service — ABS Census 2021 GCP DataPacks by POA
(CC BY 4.0; G01/G02 carry exactly the promised fields) loaded on the
sanctions-register pattern; ABS 6202.0 for employment; BoM climate averages
by station; BOCSAR/CSA/QPS et al. for crime; GTFS feeds for transport. The
live ABS SDMX API could not be verified from this environment (egress
blocked), and an unverified parser of a statistical agency's API is how the
last version of `abs-data-service` started.

**Stored reports are untouched.** The 1,085 rows carrying fabricated
demographics are delivered records; repairing history is a separate,
explicit decision, exactly as with §23's coordinates.

### Also noted

`admin-user-management` generates a temporary password with
`Math.random()` — not report data, but not a CSPRNG either. Flagged in the
allowlist as a hardening follow-up (`crypto.getRandomValues()`), with its
entry pinned so it cannot grow.

---

## §25 — The real data arrives: ABS Census by postal area (2026-09-06)

§24 removed the invented demographics; this section records their
replacement with the Australian Bureau of Statistics' own figures — loaded,
verified, and serving. The sections that used to be fabricated
(demographics, employment, SEIFA) are now **real, postcode-level, and
labelled with their true reference period**.

### What was loaded, and how it was verified

Two published ABS sources (both CC BY 4.0):

- **2021 Census GCP DataPack, POA level, Australia** — tables G01 (persons),
  G02 (medians and averages), G37 (tenure), G46 (labour force status), G54
  (industry of employment), G60 (occupation). Every column name was
  transcribed from the pack's own metadata workbook, never guessed, and a
  wrong name throws at parse — the Airtable lesson, enforced.
- **SEIFA 2021, Postal Area indexes** — all four indexes with scores and
  deciles. The workbook's column order is **IRSD first, then IRSAD** — read
  from the header and verified at parse time, because the platform's old
  fabricated shape listed IRSAD first, and assuming that order would have
  swapped *advantage* for *disadvantage* on every report.

Verification is refusal-shaped and ran before any write: a zero-row parse
refuses; a POA count outside Australia's range refuses; a national
population sum away from the Census's 25.42M refuses; a failed SEIFA join
refuses. The load that passed:

| | |
|---|---|
| census rows | **2,643** postal areas |
| national population (sum) | **25,422,756** (the Census counted 25,422,788; POAs exclude the migratory/offshore remainder) |
| SEIFA rows | **2,627**, all matched to census POAs |
| spot checks | POA 2150 medians byte-identical to the raw G02 row; Point Piper (2027) IRSAD decile 10 at $3,027/wk household income; Sydney CBD 71% renters with IER decile 1 |

Two independent implementations of the parse (a Node scaffold and the
shipped `_shared/absPoaIngest.pure.ts`) produced identical summaries on the
same files before the scaffold was deleted.

### Where the loader lives, and why

**`abs-poa-ingest` is an edge function** — the loader runs where the
credentials and the egress already live. That is the corrected form of the
sanctions-register lesson: a repository-secret loader "has never had the
secret it needs to write", and this sandbox's proxy cannot even reach
`api.data.abs.gov.au` — but Supabase's own egress fetched the DataPack from
abs.gov.au without complaint. Two invocations
(`{"stage":"seifa"}`, `{"stage":"census"}`) download, parse, verify and
upsert; the split exists because the single-pass version exceeded the edge
worker's memory (WORKER_RESOURCE_LIMIT, first invocation, recorded in the
function header). Refreshing for the 2026 Census (releases mid-2027) is:
update two URLs and the reference period, deploy, invoke.

Auth is the internal edge secret — or, exactly once, an **empty database**:
the bootstrap arm that permitted the first load seals itself the moment
`abs_census_poa` holds a row, and re-opening it would take deleting the
reference data, which already requires the service role. The sources are
public and the write is an idempotent upsert of that public data.

Also learned on the way, at the cost of one refused invocation each:
Supabase's bundler only imports from its CDN allowlist (SheetJS ships from
its own CDN; the last npm-registry release, 0.18.5, was verified to parse
the real workbook identically before being pinned), and PostgREST caps a
read at max-rows — a `.limit(5000)` silently returned 1,000 and the census
stage refused a database that was loaded, so the key read paginates.

### What serves it

`abs_census_poa` and `abs_seifa_poa` (RLS-enabled, service-read), with the
load recorded in `abs_poa_sync`. Three services now read them through one
projection module, `_shared/absCensusProjection.pure.ts`:

- **`abs-data-service`** serves population, medians (age, rent, household /
  personal / family income, mortgage), tenure rates and employment
  structure, labelled `ABS Census 2021 (POA xxxx)`.
- **`abs-employment-service`** serves the local labour force: rates with
  **named denominators** (employment rate = employed ÷ labour force; the
  employment-to-population ratio published under its own name — the
  fabricated predecessor blurred them), industries sorted by measured
  employment, the occupation breakdown, and the personal-income median.
- **`abs-seifa-service`** serves the four indexes from the loaded register.
  Its two never-verified live-API attempts were deleted — one walked the
  whole country's SDMX inside a 5-second timeout by construction.

A postcode the Census does not cover answers `no_data_for_location` through
the §24 envelope — real absence, never a neighbour's figures.

### Accuracy and timeliness, reconciled

Census figures are 2021 **because they are 2021** — the most current
authoritative postcode-level source until the 2026 Census releases — and
every block carries `referencePeriod` so no figure wears a date it does not
have. Current *conditions* stay on the live RBA retrieval beside them. The
annualised incomes are weekly medians × 52 and say so. And where one census
cannot measure change, **no change is asserted**: there is no growth field
anywhere in the projection, and the prompts now say so out loud.

### The prompts stopped lying about their tables

The generator's Demographics section used to hard-code its industry rows —
"Professional Services" was row one and "Construction" row five **for every
suburb in the country**, filled from `industries[0..4]` regardless of what
those indexes held — sourced everything as "ABS (2025)", and fell back to
ratings that asserted ("Moderate Advantage") precisely when there was no
data. `_shared/reports/censusPromptBlocks.pure.ts` composes those tables
from the data now: real industry names sorted by measured share, true
vintage labels, rows only where figures exist (law 2), one honest line when
nothing is available, and an explicit instruction that no growth figure may
be asserted because none is measured. The suburb-scope prompt's placeholder
skeleton and the regeneration function's growth lines got the same
treatment.

### What remains fabrication-free but not yet real

- **Crime** — BOCSAR (NSW) answers this sandbox (200); VIC's CSA 403s
  scripted clients (the DFAT class). Per-state loads with per-state
  reference periods are the next `abs-poa-ingest`-shaped build.
- **Climate** — BoM 403s scripted clients; SILO (Queensland government,
  BoM-derived) is blocked from this sandbox's proxy but untested from
  Supabase egress, which today proved able to reach what the sandbox
  cannot.
- **Transport detail** — the section already carries real coordinate-based
  Google transit results; GTFS adds route/frequency depth later.

Until built, those sections stay honestly absent under §24's envelope. The
`abs-poa-ingest` pattern — fetch where egress lives, parse through a pure
module under test, refuse the implausible, record the sync, label the
vintage — is the template each should follow.

## §26 — The deploy that ships all of this had been red for a day (2026-09-06)

Confirming that §24 and §25 actually reached production found the fleet
deploy failing: **thirteen consecutive `deploy-supabase-functions` runs on
main were red** (runs 487–499, 2026-09-05 06:33 → 2026-09-06 05:17), every
one with the same single line — `failed to deploy: mcp`, HTTP 413 "request
entity too large". The failure was *bounded*: the workflow deploys the fleet
alphabetically and collects failures, so every reporting function shipped
(§24's nine honest services and both generators are live from run 499;
`abs-*` deploy first in the loop). But a red run is indistinguishable from a
failed ship without reading its log, and the one function that failed had
been undeployable for 24 hours with nothing saying so.

The cause is recorded in the broken file's own header. `mcp/index.ts` is
regenerated by @lovable.dev/mcp-js's Vite plugin and hardcodes `npm:`
specifiers; the hand-written `deno.json` beside it remaps them to esm.sh,
which is the only thing that keeps the bundle deployable (measured: 38
modules / 0.69 MB mapped, against 182 dependencies / 87 MB raw — 26 MB
bundled — unmapped). On 2026-09-05 06:20 the plugin regenerated the file
from 0.26.3 to **0.28.0**; the map's keys stayed at 0.26.3; and an
import-map key that does not exactly match is **silently ignored**. The
map's own RULES block predicted precisely this ("you would be back to 25 MB
with nothing saying so") — a warning is not a gate.

Fixed by moving the two keys to 0.28.0 (the zod key still matches) and
verified the way the original map was: `deno info` shows zero npm-resolved
modules, `deno check` is clean, and the server was booted locally —
`initialize` negotiates, `tools/list` emits the zod-derived schema,
`tools/call echo` round-trips, an empty string is refused `too_small`.
`mcpFunctionImportMap.spec.ts` is the gate the warning lacked: every `npm:`
specifier in the generated entrypoint must have an exactly matching map key,
versions must agree between key and URL, every mapping must resolve to
esm.sh, and no `deno.lock` may sit beside the function (the spec caught this
audit's own local runs writing one). The spec fails on the exact broken
state that shipped; regeneration can no longer strand the map silently.

## §27 — Planning, zoning and what is coming through council (2026-09-06)

The user's confirmation of the §25 build queue led with property-level
planning: zoning, and "what developments are to be coming in the local
LGA … from a council application perspective". `planning-data-service`
delivers it from each jurisdiction's OWN planning services, on the
research doc's rules (`ZONING_BY_JURISDICTION.md`, now carrying a second
executed round).

**What a report now receives, per property coordinate:**

- **Zoning** for NSW, VIC, TAS and ACT — verbatim zone code, the
  instrument's own label, the planning instrument, LGA and the layer's own
  currency date, plus a derived national *family* that a test forbids from
  ever being printed as the zone.
- **Parcel** for QLD — surveyed lot area (labelled surveyed), lot/plan,
  tenure, LGA — the state where zoning is per-council and the cadastre is
  the strength.
- **State development instruments** for QLD — PDAs, SDAs, coordinated
  projects, infrastructure designations at the point (executed: Moranbah
  sits inside the Central Queensland Gas Pipeline coordinated project).
- **Development-application intelligence** for NSW — the Online DA API,
  no key required: executed end-to-end for Muswellbrook (183 days): 99
  applications, $66.3M stated cost of development, 83 new dwellings
  proposed, status distribution, top development types, largest projects.
  Costs stay attributed to applicants; a sample says both numbers.
- **A verification instrument sentence** per jurisdiction (s10.7 NSW,
  planning and development certificate QLD, Crown lease purpose clause
  ACT, …): the layer is indicative, the certificate is the instrument.

**The router is the services themselves.** No bounding boxes: the
integrated layers are point-queried in parallel and the polygon containing
the point answers (executed: the NSW layer answers a definite empty for a
VIC coordinate). `assessAuPoint` gates the coordinate first — §23's rule,
one implementation.

**Every absent cell says why**, and the reasons are different sentences:
QLD zoning is `not_served` (set per council scheme); WA is
`licence_restricted` (SLIP terms bar commercial republication — nothing is
fetched at all); SA/NT are `not_integrated` (every host refused this
egress; no parser may ship unverified against a response nobody has seen);
an unreachable register is `unavailable`, is never cached, and can never
read as "no zoning exists".

**Prompt honesty extended (§25's pattern):** the 38-page property prompt's
"Population & Development Trends" placeholder — which invited "[planned
infrastructure and residential developments] set to [impact]" — now
instructs the model to write ONLY from the planning block and to name no
project the data does not contain.

Verified: 30-test spec on captured live fixtures; the composed adapters
executed against all five services and the DA register through the shipped
code; deno check clean; column gate, verify-jwt gate (427/427) and the
deterministic inventory regenerated in order. The `planning_data_cache`
migration is applied in production; the service and rewired generator ship
on merge.

## §28 — Recorded crime arrives: BOCSAR and QPS by the platform's own geography (2026-09-06)

Q1 of the confirmed build queue. The §24 crime fabricator (postcode bands
inventing counts, a `safetyScore`, "22% higher than state average") is
replaced by two loaded registers, production-verified byte-identical to
their sources:

- **NSW — BOCSAR recorded criminal incidents by month by POSTCODE**: 622
  postcodes × 21 offence categories, Jan 1995 → Dec 2025, quarterly
  releases. Postcode-keyed — the same geography as everything else.
- **QLD — QPS reported offences by LGA**: 78 LGAs × 92 offence columns,
  Jan 2001 → **Jul 2026**, monthly releases. The LGA arrives from the
  planning cadastre's own shire name (§27) and matches the register by
  the same normalised-token rule the DA lookup uses.

Three measured quirks carry the load: QPS's stray apostrophe in
`Common Assault'` (the file's own header, transcribed exactly); an
unnamed 95th cell on every QPS row that is a running row counter,
validated and discarded; and a column set that MIXES rollups with details
— the hierarchy was measured (400/400 rows per identity), the ingest
re-checks it per load, and the reading presents one level at a time so
nothing double-counts.

The reading is counts and their arithmetic: 12-month totals against the
prior window, six complete calendar years, and a per-100k rate **whose
denominator is named** — the NSW benchmark divides by the 2021 Census
population of exactly the file's own 622 postcodes (all 622 matched):
617,838 recorded offences ≈ 7,598/100k. QLD offers state count-change
context and no rate, because no LGA population source is integrated yet.
No score, rating or adjective — a spec bans the fabricated vocabulary
from the reading, the service and the prompt block, and both fabrication-
shaped prompt templates (`overallRating || 'Medium'`, `Safety Score
XX/100`) are replaced by the composed block.

Two lessons were paid for on the first production load and are recorded
in `CRIME_SOURCES.md`: a whole-table bootstrap seals after stage one (the
arm is per state now), and a 60 MB inflated string exceeds the edge
worker (the NSW stage streams the zip's single deflate entry located from
the central directory — verified byte-identical to the whole-string parse
before deploying). Other states answer `no_data_for_location` naming
their real register; VIC's CSA refuses scripted clients, the DFAT class.

## §29 — Climate arrives: SILO at the property's own grid cell (2026-09-06)

Q2 of the confirmed queue. The §24 climate fabricator (one rainfall for
all of NSW, Bourke to Bondi, cached 365 days) is replaced by the
Queensland Government's SILO Data Drill: monthly values interpolated onto
a ~5 km grid from Bureau of Meteorology observations, CC BY 4.0 with the
licence stated in the response itself. One request per grid cell covers
1991 → the last complete month; `climateReading.pure.ts` computes the
Bureau's standard **1991–2020 normals** and refuses a normal over a hole,
an implausible value (the sentinel guard), a headerless error page or a
truncated series.

Three honesty rules carry the reading: the hottest, coldest, wettest and
driest months are **named from the data**, never assumed to be January and
July (executed: Wyndham Vale's wettest month is November — the western
Melbourne rain shadow — while Brisbane's is February); the recent 12
complete months are compared **like for like** against the same calendar
months' normal, never "this year so far" against a full-year figure; and
the basis is disclosed — an interpolated grid value, not a station record,
with the SILO/BoM attribution its licence asks for.

Executed against the live service for three corpus coordinates before
shipping (Brisbane 1,103.8 mm, Parramatta 890.3 mm, Wyndham Vale
458.9 mm annual normals, all with recent windows through 2026-08). The
service caches per grid cell (`climate_normals_cache`, 30-day TTL, applied
in production), answers honestly without a coordinate, and a transport
failure or refused parse is `unavailable` and never cached.

The prompt honesty extends to the whole **Environmental Risks & Climate**
section: the old template attributed placeholder fallbacks to the Bureau
(`climateZone || 'Temperate'`, `XX.X°C` cells labelled BoM) and RATED
hazards nothing measures (`Storms | Moderate`, `Cyclones | Low` as
literals, heatwave/bushfire/flood falling back to asserted levels exactly
when no assessment existed). `climateStatBlocks` renders measured figures
with their windows, hazard rows only where the risk services returned a
real level, and instructs the model to name no climate zone and rate no
unmeasured hazard. The suburb snapshot's placeholder risk table got the
same treatment.

## §30 — Macro figures from the RBA's own tables, not a search model (2026-09-06)

**Q3 of the confirmed queue.** The Current Economic Context section was the
last place a report's figures came from a model rather than a register:
`rba-data-service` asked Perplexity for "exact current values", coerced
absences with `|| 0` (a 0.0% unemployment rate), stamped every figure with
the retrieval date, and labelled a ten-year CPI path "RBA SMP forecast"
whether or not any forecast had been read — while the generator printed
hardcoded fallbacks (`|| '4.10'` on the cash rate, a year stale against the
real 4.35%) under a heading that said "VERIFIED ECONOMIC DATA", and
`financial-calculator-service` indexed real dollar arithmetic against the
model's projections.

The figures now come from three published RBA statistical tables — F1.1
(cash rate target), G1 (consumer price inflation) and F5 (indicator lending
rates) — parsed by `_shared/rbaTables.pure.ts` from layouts transcribed off
the real files, loaded into `rba_observations`/`rba_series_meta`, and
composed by `_shared/rbaReading.pure.ts`. The acquisition log is
`docs/reports/MACRO_SOURCES.md`. What was measured before anything was
written: **rba.gov.au 403s this project's egress** (Akamai, all three CSVs,
probe deployed and executed), so the ingest takes the sanctions-register
shape — `scripts/rba/load-rba-tables.mjs` downloads where egress works and
POSTs the text verbatim; ALL parsing is server-side, refusal-shaped
(layout drift, truncation floors, per-units plausibility bounds, absent
wanted series), and **an empty value cell is an absent observation, never
zero** — G1 pre-prints future ABS reference periods with empty cells, and
reading one as 0 prints a 100-point CPI collapse.

The reading serves every figure with its own reference period ("4.35%,
monthly average, August 2026"; "3.9% year-ended, June quarter 2026") and
each table's own publication date; the cash rate's last move is dated by
arithmetic on the series (June 2026, 4.31 → 4.35), never asserted as a
board decision; the investor lending rates the old path never had are
served beside the owner-occupier ones (investor standard variable 9.35%,
July 2026). **GDP, unemployment and participation left the response and
the prompt entirely** — these tables do not measure them, a test asserts
the vocabulary is absent, and the prompt block forbids the model from
stating them (the timeliness stream brings measured labour figures). The
CPI path the financial engine indexes against is now
`cpiProjectionsFromMeasured` — the ONE implementation, the engine's silent
local convergence copy deleted — and every year's label begins
"Assumption —"; a test asserts no year can claim SMP, Treasury or
forecast.

Loaded and verified in production before merge: 11 series, 3,518
observations via the shipped loader; the per-table bootstrap arms sealed
(re-POST without the secret answers 403); the service's four-year window
measured at 394 rows against PostgREST's 1,000-row cap; and the store's
figures re-checked by SQL (4.35 / 3.9 / 9.35). The stale search-model
cache entry (`economic_data_cache`, `rba_indicators`, fetched 2026-09-04)
was purged — nothing reads or writes it any more.

## §31 — The first measured growth figures: ERP by the property's own SA2 (2026-09-06)

**Q4 of the confirmed queue, first half.** Every "population growth" figure
in every report was model memory: the Census tables carry 2021 levels and
no trend, and the prompts asked for growth prose anyway — the Demand
Drivers skeleton went as far as demanding an annual job-growth percentage,
a participation rate and an unemployment rate no source measured.

Population is measured now. `abs-regional-ingest` fetches the ABS Regional
population datacube itself (abs.gov.au answers this project's egress —
probed before building; the ABS SDMX API and the SALM hosts refuse it) and
`_shared/absRegional.pure.ts` parses ERP at 30 June per SA2, 2001–2025,
refusal-shaped: drifted headers, a broken year run, an implausible count
or value, or a latest-year national total outside the measured
plausibility anchor (27,613,654) all refuse the load; the file's ".."
marker is an absent observation, never zero (Norfolk Island's
pre-inclusion years — the one SA2 that carries it), while a measured 0 is
a real value. Loaded in production before merge: 2,454 SA2s, 61,335
observations — 61,350 minus Norfolk's 15 absences, the count being the
rule working.

The reading is the property's OWN area: `abs-regional-service` resolves
the coordinate to its SA2 through the ABS ASGS2021 geoserver (measured
reachable; cached per ~110 m cell, transport failures never cached) and
serves that SA2's series with 1/5/10-year growth windows that render only
where both endpoints were measured, never bridging a hole and never rating
growth against a zero base. Executed end-to-end on the real workbook: the
Parramatta test coordinate's SA2 (125041717 "Parramatta - North") reads
14,904 residents at 30 June 2025, +478 (+3.31%) in a year, +74.21% over
ten — figures of exactly the kind reports used to invent, now carrying
their windows and release.

The unemployment half (SALM, DEWR) is one operator action from done and
deliberately not guessed at: every vantage this programme holds is refused
at the IP level by DEWR's hosts, no reachable mirror carries the current
file, and the parser doctrine (transcribe from the real file, refuse
drift) cannot be satisfied against a file nobody can reach.
`docs/reports/REGIONAL_TRENDS.md` records the gate; the service serves
`unemployment: null`; the prompt blocks FORBID stating a rate; and the
Demand Drivers skeleton that demanded invented labour figures is rewritten
to draw only on measured tables.

## §32 — The regeneration path had drifted out of parity (2026-09-07)

Found while taking stock after the timeliness stream: **a regenerated
report was not the same report.** `regenerate-report-qualitative` is the
path a client's report takes when an operator revises it, and it had
fallen behind the generator on every stream shipped this programme.

Four faults, each of which reported as normal operation:

**It read shapes the services no longer produce.** The context block
composed its own crime and climate prose from the pre-rework fields —
`crime.safetyScore`, `crime.comparisonToState`, `climate.climateZone`,
`climate.temperature.summer/winter`, `climate.rainfall.annual`. The crime
rework deleted that vocabulary outright (a spec bans the word
`safetyScore` from the module) and the climate rework deleted zone naming
because naming a zone is exactly what the fabricator did. So eight
labelled rows rendered **"N/A" on every regenerated report** — the "blank
a model should fill" invitation this programme exists to remove, sitting
in the one path nobody re-read after the reworks.

**It asked a coordinate-keyed service without the coordinate.** Climate
was called with `{suburb, state, postcode}`; since the SILO rewrite made
the coordinate the question, that call could only ever answer
`no_data_for_location`. Climate was unconditionally absent from every
regenerated report.

**It never asked two services at all** — planning and regional trends were
not on the path, so a regenerated report silently lost the zoning block
and the population trends a freshly generated one carries.

**It misnamed five of its own sources** in the client-facing attribution
list: climate credited straight to the *Bureau of Meteorology* (it is
SILO, the Queensland Government's BoM-derived grid, whose CC BY 4.0
licence asks for its own attribution), schools to *ACARA/MySchool* and
*NAPLAN* (a schools directory and Google Places), employment to the *ABS
Labour Force Survey* (the Census), market data to *Domain/CoreLogic*
(CoreLogic is deliberately not integrated), and crime to *safety scores*
that no longer exist. A misnamed source is a fabricated citation, and it
sat under the heading "This report utilises data from the following
authoritative sources".

The fix is the doctrine, not a patch: **one rendering per reading.** Both
paths now import the same five prompt blocks (`crimeStatBlocks`,
`climateStatBlocks`, `planningStatBlocks`, `regionalTrendBlocks`,
`macroEconomicBlock`) rather than keeping private copies; the three
coordinate-keyed services are asked together after `locationTask`
resolves, with the coordinate, mirroring the generator (including its
QLD second-chance crime ask once the cadastre names the shire); and every
attribution names the register that actually served the block.
`regenerationParity.spec.ts` pins all four rules — a repo-wide sweep
confirmed this path was the last live reader of the deleted shapes.

Also measured while here, and recorded rather than acted on: **VIC's crime
register refuses this project's egress too** (403 from Supabase, matching
the sandbox), so Victoria stays honestly absent. SA's and NT's open-data
portals DO answer from this vantage — the first reachable route to those
two registers, unbuilt for now.

## §33 — Phase 3, part C: a stored report becomes addressable (2026-09-07)

Full account: [`SECTION_STORAGE.md`](./SECTION_STORAGE.md).

Part B built `partitionByRegistry` and verified it against four real documents
spanning both engines and three tiers. Part C's first act was to run it over
**all 1,199 stored reports**, and that measurement overturned the primitive.

### The partition was blind to 70% of the corpus

It read `##` headings only — as did the coverage fixture that vouched for it,
and both were wrong about the same thing.

| | reports | share |
|---|---|---|
| sections written at **H1** | **842** | **70.2%** |
| sections written at H2 | 357 | 29.8% |

The majority is the legacy 36-section document, `# 1. Location Overview` …
`# 36. Demographic & Economic Data`, carrying at most a `## 📞 CONTACT US` /
`## ⚖️ PROFESSIONAL DISCLAIMER` pair at H2. **A partition hard-coded to `##`
finds zero sections in 842 documents and hands back each whole report as
preamble** — indistinguishable from a report with no structure at all.

`detectSectionLevel` now decides per document, by asking which level's headings
**resolve to registry sections** rather than by counting headings: H3
sub-headings outnumber sections in the H2 cohort (36 a document), so "most
headings" picks the wrong level. A tie resolves to 2, preserving every
previously verified behaviour.

### The coverage guard was measuring a quarter of what it claimed

`fixtures/corpusHeadings.json` was H2-only for the same reason, so §21's
percentage was computed over **10,185 heading instances while 26,860 sat
outside it**. Ten headings the registry could not name carried more than 400
reports each and none of them could have surfaced — `12. Amenity Scores` on
578, `22. Principal & Interest Loan` on 541, `28. Final Loan-to-Value Ratio
(LVR)` on 541.

Thirteen aliases were added from that inventory. Across all 575 fixture rows
they are **purely additive**: 30 headings gained a section, **0 changed section
and 0 lost one**. H1 instance resolution went **78.9% → 96.0%**, and the corpus
gained **4,692 addressable sections** — 26,581 → 31,273, 22.2 → 26.1 a report.
The fixture carries `level` now and both halves; its H1 side has a floor of ten
reports rather than two, because below ten that inventory is dominated by title
blocks naming a client's property, which are neither sections nor ours to keep
in a repository.

Two section headings are deliberately **not** named and are frozen with the
reason, the way `PRODUCER_GAPS` is: `37. Methodology Notes`, because the corpus
writes it as a colon sub-heading on 31 reports against 22 as a section and
normalisation cannot tell them apart; and `6. Investment Insights`, a real
section on 17 reports whose target the corpus does not settle.

### The storage rules

- **A repeat is an occurrence, never a merge.** The key is `(report_id,
  ordinal)`. Briefing `89b451f6` carries `marketPosition` four times; keying on
  `(report_id, section_id)` would silently collapse a client's document.
- **An index is written only where re-assembly proves it lossless**, and a
  report that fails gets a row saying so with **no** section rows. Measured:
  **1,199 of 1,199 conserve**; nothing was refused. The whole corpus is now
  indexed in production — 31,273 section rows across 37 distinct ids, the
  deepest repeat being **10 occurrences of one id in a single report** — and
  re-assembling every document **in SQL** from the stored rows reproduces its
  non-whitespace content exactly, **1,199 of 1,199, 0 mismatched**. That second
  proof runs on a different implementation from the one that wrote the rows,
  which is what makes it worth taking: it sees truncation at the column, a lost
  row and a wrong ordinal, and the in-memory check cannot.
- **The stored counts describe what is stored** — a refused report reads zero,
  because `total_sections = 21` beside no rows is the shape this programme
  removes.
- **9 reports (0.8%) yield no section** and are indexed as preamble-only, which
  is a truthful description rather than a failure.

### The deployment was checked against this repository, not assumed to match it

`report-sections-index` answers a `sample` — it partitions text it is handed and
reads nothing — and every response carries a `registry` digest, a SHA-256 over
every normalised alias and the section it owns. The 2026-09-07 deployment
returned digest `976341c1…`, 226 headings, and a fixture index identical field
for field with the local run, before a single row was written.

Nothing reads the index yet: `sectionIdForHeading` still has no consumer in a
shipped document path, so these aliases changed the index and no client's
report. Assembling a tier's document *from* stored sections is the next part.

## §34 — Two more recorded-crime registers: SA and NT (2026-09-07)

§32 recorded that SA's and NT's open-data portals answer this project's egress
where VIC's refuses. They are integrated now, the same way NSW and QLD were:
every column name transcribed from the real file, every bound measured from
the real data, and a file that drifts refusing rather than loading something
else. Eight files were parsed in full before a line of schema was written, and
each parse was cross-checked against an independent implementation.

### SAPOL reclassified its offences, and a crosswalk would have been an invention

The finding that shaped the design. **From 2025-07 SAPOL changed its offence
classification, and it is a reclassification rather than a rename.** Eight of
its nine Level 2 categories changed name — `ACTS INTENDED TO CAUSE INJURY` →
`ASSAULT`, `THEFT AND RELATED OFFENCES` → `THEFT`, `PROPERTY DAMAGE AND
ENVIRONMENTAL` → `PROPERTY DAMAGE` — and the tempting move is a mapping.

The Level 3 leaves say no. `THEFT` carries `Theft from retail premises`,
`Theft from a person` and `Motor vehicle theft and related offences` where the
old category carried `Theft from shop`, `Theft from motor vehicle` and
`Theft/Illegal Use of MV`; `HARM OR ENDANGER PERSONS` (`Abduction and
kidnapping`, `Acts that threaten, harass, or control`, `Driving causing
serious injury`) corresponds to no single old category at all. **The
boundaries moved.** A "change on the same window a year earlier" computed
across a hand-made crosswalk would be a confident number that is not a
like-for-like comparison — this programme's own failure class, arrived at
through diligence rather than laziness.

So SA is stored at two grains. **Level 1** (`OFFENCES AGAINST PROPERTY` /
`AGAINST THE PERSON`) is stable in all seven published files and measured
continuous across the boundary — the monthly series shows no step at 2025-07,
property running ~6,900–8,000 a month either side and person ~2,100–2,700 —
so it carries the total, the year-on-year change and six calendar years.
**Level 2** is stored for the current classification only, with `prior12`
NULL and a `series_note` saying why. 1,836 of SA's 2,527 postcode rows carry
that null, and all 1,836 carry the note.

`crime_reference.prior12` became nullable for this, and the report block
renders `not comparable` rather than a blank cell — a blank reads as missing
data, and a model handed a blank and no reason will reach for one.

### Three more SAPOL quirks, and NT's opposite of the QLD trap

**The catalogue holds a trap beside the data.** Sixteen Family & Domestic
Abuse files sit next to the sixteen crime files, and SAPOL's own note is
explicit that the FDA file is a SUBSET of the crime file for the same year and
the two must not be added together. The matcher recognises only the crime
family; every FDA name returns null.

**One postcode arrives under two spellings** — `0872` with 699 offences and
`872` with 9 more, one postal area split by an export that lost a leading
zero. **And SAPOL records incidents outside the state**, 27–55 rows a year on
NSW, VIC, QLD, WA and TAS postcodes; keeping them would put "2 recorded
offences" against Sydney's postcode 2000 in a register that is not Sydney's.

**NT's rows are a cross-tabulation, not a hierarchy** — the opposite of QLD's
rollup trap, and measured rather than assumed: across 7,256 distinct (period,
offence, area) keys, **0 carry a repeated (alcohol, DV) cell and 0 mix the `-`
marker with Yes/No**, so summing them is exact. It is re-checked on every load.
Its header carries `Offence type ` with a trailing space, transcribed exactly
for the reason QPS's `Common Assault'` apostrophe is.

### A row the register declines to place is not a malformed row

The first parser conflated them and refused SAPOL's own data. `NOT DISCLOSED`
in the postcode column is South Australia Police saying the location is not
published — a stable feature of every file at **1.18%–1.90% of rows**. Rows of
the wrong SHAPE are a different thing, and the measured worst case is ONE in
84,949. They now have separate counters and separate caps, and the ratio
checks do not run at all below 500 rows, because one unplaced row in four is
25% and says nothing about whether a column moved. Truncation is asked
separately, by the loader, against each register's own measured floor.

### Loaded and verified in production

Every figure the deployed function reported matched the local parse to the
digit — 9,723 NT rows / 84,862 offences / 7,256 cross-tab keys, and SA's seven
years at 83,304–98,687 rows each. Finalised: 2,527 SA postcode rows, 67 NT
region rows and 181 SA2 rows. SA's benchmark names its denominator the way
NSW's does: 116,151 offences over 1,790,479 2021 Census usual residents of the
342 matched postal areas = 6,487 per 100k. NT keeps `population` null and
offers count-change context only, because no population is published for a
reporting region and a rate with an unnamed denominator is the one thing this
layer will not publish.

VIC still refuses every vantage; WA, TAS and ACT remain unverified and are
answered `no_data_for_location` naming their real register.

## §35 — The last fabricator is replaced: real transport stops (2026-09-07)

Full account: [`TRANSPORT_SOURCES.md`](./TRANSPORT_SOURCES.md).

§24 named six acquisition paths. Demographics, SEIFA, climate, crime and the
macro figures are real; employment is stalled on SALM's IP-level refusal. The
sixth, **public transport, had never been started** — and it was the clearest
fabricator of the six: eight per-state "fetchers" that ignored the coordinate
entirely, so every NSW property was 450m from Central Station with the T1–T8
lines and every VIC property 250m from a Swanston Street tram. That invention
was cached for 30 days and drove **up to 30 points of every report's walk
score** through `location-intelligence-service`.

`transport_stops` now holds **185,177 real stops** across four networks, each
loaded from the operator's own published GTFS feed.

### The archive is addressed, not downloaded

The constraint that shaped everything. NSW's bundle is **292,247,414 bytes**
and VIC's 319,320,298 — neither fits the crime-ingest pattern. But
`shapes.txt` alone is 77% of NSW's download and answers nothing about what is
near a property, while `stops.txt` is 4.09 MB compressed.

Every publisher measured honours HTTP range requests and a zip's central
directory sits at the END, so the archive is addressed rather than fetched:
read the tail, parse the directory, take one member. **1.467% of NSW's
archive, in 5.2 seconds, inflating byte-exact to the 16,997,242 bytes the
archive declares.** That is the difference between this fitting in an Edge
Function and not.

### What only real data revealed: a station is not its platforms

Within 1.6 km of the Parramatta test coordinate the table holds **thirteen
rows all carrying `parent_station: 215020`** — Platforms 1–4, Stands A1, A2,
B1–B3, Darcy St, two KAR Fizwilliam St and a TXI Fizwilliam St. A
nearest-eight over the rows lists six platforms of one station and calls them
six stops. Grouping by the publisher's own `parent_station` collapses sixteen
real rows to six places, named by the station rather than the platform.

### The rule that governs an empty answer

**A stop found is a fact about the area; no stop found is a fact about the
FEEDS.** A Perth property is not badly served — it is outside every network
loaded, and saying "no stops nearby" about it is the
confident-answer-against-nothing failure this programme has removed twice.
`outside_loaded_networks` is therefore a distinct verdict returned as
`no_data_for_location` naming the networks held, and coverage is decided by
measured distance rather than by a state name.

Victoria is **declared and deliberately not loaded**: PTV nests eight per-mode
archives inside one zip, each deflated rather than stored, so a member cannot
be range-addressed without inflating up to 139 MB. It keeps its entry with
`loadable: false` and a rendered reason, because a feed that vanished would
let an empty answer read as "no public transport in Victoria".

### Nothing returns a score, and mode is absent

The invented `qualityScore` is what corrupted the walk score, and a score from
stop counts alone would be the same invention in new clothes — a stop served
hourly counts the same as one served every four minutes. Mode is NULL on every
row because it lives behind `stop_times.txt` (399 MB uncompressed for NSW), so
the reading omits it rather than guessing from a stop's name. `notMeasured`
says both on every answer, including a full one.

### Three faults the loader found by running rather than by being read

**The bootstrap arm counted the whole table**, so loading `nt_darwin` sealed
`nt_alice` and `qld_seq` out of their own first load — the exact fault its own
comment described. **Counting any row then sealed a feed on its FAILURE**: NSW
was killed at 117,000 of 171,061, left a `running` row, and refused its own
resume, which could lock a feed permanently half-loaded. And **`HEAD` is not
how you ask an archive's length** — TransLink answers HEAD with no
`content-length` while answering a ranged GET with `Content-Range:
bytes 0-0/37356493`, so a perfectly range-addressable feed was written off.

A fourth belongs to the tooling rather than the data: a deployed Supabase
function **cannot hash its own sources** (they are compiled away; every
`import.meta.url` read answers "path not found"), so the fidelity check
digests what the modules DO. Repo and deployment agree on
`47d61cace23e474dddc827ce80326037207c33772080903085e28568f4e57e41`.

SA, TAS and ACT were reported as refusing "every vantage this project holds"
when only the repo sandbox had tried them. That asserted more than had been
measured, about exactly the distinction `probe` exists to make, and §35a
corrects it.

---

## §35a — The claim that had not been measured (2026-09-07)

§35 recorded SA, TAS and ACT as refusing "every vantage this project holds".
Only one vantage had ever tried them: this repository's sandbox. The Edge
Function that would actually do the loading had never asked — which is the
precise distinction the loader's own `probe` stage was built around, and the
reason SALM is stalled rather than guessed at. The claim happened to be right,
and that is luck rather than rigour.

`GTFS_CANDIDATES` and the `probe_candidates` stage exist so it rests on
evidence. Measured from both vantages: Adelaide Metro, Transport Canberra and
Metro Tasmania all answer **403 at the Edge Function too**, so the three are
now genuinely established rather than assumed.

**WA turns out to be a different state, and was being described as the same
one.** Transperth's published GTFS page answers 200 from both vantages, but
its 82 KB of static HTML names no archive at all (the page is client-rendered)
and a headless Chromium cannot reach the site from this environment either.
Transperth is not refusing the data; this project has not established where the
archive lives. Recording that as a refusal would repeat the same error in the
other direction.

Two rules came out of it. **A candidate is probed and never loaded** —
admitting one means moving it into `GTFS_FEEDS` with a stop floor a real parse
produced. And **the candidate list is FIXED**: a probe taking a URL from the
request body would be server-side request forgery in a function holding
service-role credentials, which is far worse than an unprobed feed.

It also caught a trap in the first version: `probe`, `probe_candidates` and
`digest` were gated on `succeeded < loadable feeds`, so **the diagnostics
sealed themselves the moment every feed had loaded** — when a maintainer most
needs them, and making `probe_candidates` unusable by construction since it
exists for networks that are not loaded. They are permitted behind the gateway
JWT now; the per-feed seal on the load stages is untouched.

## §36 — One definition per figure, and the first arithmetic check the product has ever had (2026-09-07)

Full detail: [`DERIVED_FIGURES.md`](./DERIVED_FIGURES.md).

Every report states three numbers a client acts on that the property record
does not contain — gross rental yield, net rental yield, loan-to-value ratio.
Nothing checked any of them after the model wrote it. `runQAValidation`'s seven
rules are page band, keyword presence, placeholders, editorial labels,
duplicate headings and section counts: **no rule in this product had ever
compared a number.**

**The divergence was mostly not a bug, and finding that out changed the work.**
Gross yield is computed in six places, net yield in four, LVR in eight. But
`liveProjectionRow.ts` divides the settlement loan by the purchase price while
the strategy surfaces divide the remaining balance by today's value — those are
*different quantities*, origination LVR and current LVR, and they coincide only
at settlement. Collapsing them onto one definition would have destroyed a real
distinction and silently changed documents. What was missing was a NAME for
each and a way to say which you meant, so in
`_shared/reports/metrics/propertyMetrics.pure.ts` **the basis is part of the
call**, the answer carries its basis back, and `labelFor` prints "Gross yield
(on purchase price)" rather than a bare "Gross yield". Two rules travel with
it: **absent is never zero** — 84 of 1,072 stored reports print a `0.00%`
yield, 206 times, because the rent was unknown — and **net yield is unlevered
while cash-on-cash is not**, pinned by a test showing the same property at
3.39% and −1.73% depending on whether interest was wrongly swept into the cost
base.

`reconcileFacts` now judges all three, and they are the strongest possible
targets because the prompt does not merely supply them, it orders their use
("USE THESE EXACTLY - DO NOT RECALCULATE"). The call site passes the exact
variables the prompt interpolates, because recomputing them would only prove
that two formulas agree. Three things had to be right. **Tolerance is absolute
for a percentage** — a 2% relative band on 4.83 is ±0.097, which rejects the
ordinary rounding "5%" — so yields carry 0.25 points and LVR 0.5. **The
vocabulary was measured**: 543 of 2,153 gross mentions are a working column
(`| Gross Rental Yield | $33,800 ÷ $700,000 × 100 | 4.83% |`), so the pattern
must cross arithmetic, and it is bounded by never crossing a newline, a `%`, or
a second `yield`. And **a wide gap alone is not enough** — the corpus long tail
read "gross rental yield provides substantial buffering against interest rate
increases. A 1%" as the figure — so the value must arrive either through a
delimiter (a table pipe, a colon, an `=`) or sitting adjacent to the label. A
verb may never introduce the number.

**LVR is the one place a value-after-label rule had to be refused.** `LVR, 6.5%`
and `LVR at 6.5%` are the interest rate; `banks cap LVR at 95%` is policy;
`| Final LVR | 52% |` is the correct *current* LVR at year ten. A prose-connective
rule read 22 of 57 reports as contradicted and almost all of it was the
detector. Admitting only the value-first form and structurally-connected label
forms doubled coverage (57 reports → 115) and cut disagreement to 10.

Those 10 are all one real defect, and it is not the model's. **14 of 143 stored
reports contradict themselves inside `financial_calculations`**: a deposit
taken at 20% of the price beside a loan taken at 90% of it, `keyMetrics.lvr`
of 80 beside `loanDetails.lvr` of 90. On one, the deposit and the loan come to
$739,200 against a $672,000 purchase — the client is shown two lines that
exceed what they are buying by $67,200 — while the customer's own override says
80% and names the right loan. The written analysis then says "90% LVR" nine to
twelve times, because the loan block is what the model was handed.
`financeIdentityBreaches` states the three identities a finance block cannot
break and still describe one deal, and discloses them beside the prose
findings. It is deliberately **not** repaired here: the engine itself is
self-consistent, so a later merge is putting the two halves out of step, and
finding which one is a change to how a report is generated that deserves its
own evidence.

`derivedFigureDefinitions.spec.ts` is a ratchet rather than a ban — 22 modules,
53 inline definitions, frozen. It does not forbid the copies, because most of
them are the real distinction above; it fixes their number so the next one is a
decision somebody makes rather than a line somebody adds. Stamp duty had
exactly this shape and reached four *different* answers before anyone compared
them.

## §37 — The 0.00% yield, and the record that described two deals (2026-09-07)

Full detail: [`DERIVED_FIGURES.md`](./DERIVED_FIGURES.md) §5 and §6. Both were
found by §36's reconciliation and both are now fixed at the cause.

**The yield: two rents, in two scopes.** 83 stored reports print a `0.00%`
rental yield, 74 of them with no rent supplied by the customer, and the zero
flowed onward — annual income `$0`, a *net* yield that was a confident negative
number made of nothing but costs, and a model ordered to "USE THESE EXACTLY".
The generator resolved the rent twice: `effectiveWeeklyRent` knew only what a
person typed, while the SQM market lookup landed in `calcWeeklyRent`, declared
**inside the enrichment block** and out of scope by the time the prompt was
assembled. So a report whose rent came from the lookup had correct projections
beside a document saying the yield was zero. Four prompt lines had already been
patched by hand with `|| enhancedData.financials?.income?.weeklyRent` — someone
had seen the symptom — but a per-line patch cannot fix a figure computed once
from the wrong variable. **A third consumer had it too**: the investment
scoring service was handed `weeklyRent: effectiveWeeklyRent || 0` and scored
the property as earning nothing (mean score 47.5 against 48.9 elsewhere).

`rentalEvidence.pure.ts` resolves **one** rent, in the calculator's own order,
carrying whether it is established at all; where it is not, every figure
derived from it is absent and the prompt forbids an estimate while still
permitting qualitative discussion — a prohibition with no permitted action is
one a model routes around. Three things make it safe on a path that has run on
every investment report ever generated: the ordering returns the same number
the old expression did wherever a rent was typed or carried (the spec asserts
that against the old expression, not against an idea of it); arithmetic keeps
its zero, because management fees are a percentage OF the rent; and the `%`
sign moved INSIDE the formatter, since every call site read
`${preCalculatedGrossYield}%` and a null there would have printed `null%`.

One thing was deliberately **not** adopted, and measuring is what settled it.
Routing the pre-calculated yields through `propertyMetrics.grossYield` would be
the tidier call, but swept over 2,207,223 realistic (rent, price) pairs its
`Math.round(x * 100) / 100` disagrees with `toFixed(2)` on **2,763** of them —
half-way values like 1.105 printing as 1.10 one way and 1.11 the other. That is
0.125% of documents shifted by a hundredth for no reader's benefit. The module
owns the definition; the generator owns the presentation.

**The finance identity: healed on read, not migrated.** 21 stored reports carry
a deposit taken at one LVR beside a loan taken at another — on one, $134,400
and $604,800 against a $672,000 purchase, exceeding it by $67,200 while the
customer's own override names the right loan ($537,600). The live path is
already sound: `manage-investment-reports` recomputes through the engine, and
**17 reports carried an LVR override in August and September and all 17 are
consistent**, against 10 broken of 33 in April–June. What remained was history.

The naive repair is wrong. "The loan is stale, re-derive it from price minus
deposit" invents a third figure on the one row where it is the *deposit* that
is stale. **`keyMetrics.lvr` is the arbiter** — the engine derives it from the
inputs it was actually given — so whichever half agrees with it survives and
the other is re-derived; where NEITHER agrees, nothing is healed, because a
repair that cannot say which figure is sound is just a third opinion. Verified
against all 21: 17 heal the loan, 1 heals the deposit, 3 are left alone, and of
the 13 carrying an independent witness (`manual_overrides.loanAmount`) **13
agree and none contradict**.

It lives in `reconcileStoredFinancials`, which the register, the PDF renderer,
the comparison and both cash-flow projections already call — so the repair
reaches every reader of all 21 rows **without a migration and without
overwriting a stored byte**, reversible by deleting code rather than restoring
a backup. Placement is load-bearing: after the series heal (the projections'
ROI denominator is the stored deposit, and re-basing a ten-year table would
rewrite rows this has no business touching) and before the upfront total (which
IS the deposit plus the acquisition lines and must follow). The same function
runs at the write boundary too, on the two paths where the recompute is skipped
and the client's own object is stored.

## §38 — Portfolio: deterministic code becomes the sole numerical authority (2026-09-07)

Full detail: [`PORTFOLIO_TRUST_BOUNDARY.md`](./PORTFOLIO_TRUST_BOUNDARY.md).

The Portfolio generator handed the model the portfolio's own metrics and then
asked for numbers back in its JSON schema — rate-sensitivity impacts, current
cashflow, current repayments, projected value and equity, borrowing-capacity
utilisation. **It was not doing arithmetic**, and the corpus shows something
worse than inaccuracy: the field does not hold one quantity. Every client with
a stored sensitivity block holds interest-only loans, so the true step is exact
(`balance × Δ ÷ 12`) and needs no term — and measured against those loans, of
the 13 blocks whose loans carry a recorded structure, **4 encode the monthly
level *after* the rise, 3 encode the change itself, and 6 are wrong under both
readings** (best-case error: median $718 a month, $10,611 at worst). All of
them print under the same PDF label. One report's +2% figure ($0.15) is smaller
than its +1% ($1,010.15), which no rate rise can produce. One
`currentMonthlyCashflow` differed by $492 a month from the `portfolioMetrics`
figure sitting beside it in the same object. **A field that means two things is
not repairable by prompt wording**, which is why the fix moves the producer
rather than the instructions.

**The trace came first, and it changed the design twice.** Two different fields
share the name `interestRateSensitivity` — a numeric object read only by the
pdf-lib generator, and a PROSE string under `riskAssessment` read by the
WeasyPrint normaliser; conflating them would have blanked a risk row. And
**there is no loan term in this data model** — not unpopulated, no such column,
while `loan_repayment_amount` exists and is populated on 0 of 47 loans.

That last fact splits the mathematics rather than being worked around. An
interest-only loan is exact as `balance × rate ÷ 12` — verified against the
data, where `monthly_interest_repayment` equals that expression for 20 of 20
interest-only loans and 0 of 21 principal-and-interest ones, which is how we
know it is not the same quantity there. A P&I loan needs a term to amortise and
is **refused rather than assumed**: a thirty-year guess on a loan with eight
years left misstates both the payment and the shock. A group containing any
unmodellable loan is unavailable in whole, because a figure covering three
loans of four understates the exposure while sitting beside the portfolio's
full debt. Across the 23 clients holding loans that is 15 exact and 8 absent —
a strict improvement on a figure produced for all 23 and wrong for most. The
remedy for the rest is a data change (capture a loan term), named and out of
scope.

**Fifteen deterministic fields left the model's schema.** Not computed and then
compared — *not asked*, so there is nothing to overwrite and nothing to
reconcile. `healthScore` and `diversificationScore` stay model-authored and are
bounded 0–100 on the way out, **dropped rather than clamped** when out of
range, because clamping 250 to 100 publishes an excellent rating the model
never gave. Cashflow has one authority: the assembly assigns
`portfolioMetrics.netMonthlyCashflow` directly, so no second derivation exists
to disagree with it.

Three rules carry it. **The persisted shape did not change** — both renderers
read the same paths and the new fields are additive — so historical rows still
render, and the renderer hides a figure only on an explicit `available ===
false`, which a stored row does not carry. That was checked by execution rather
than by reading the guard: across all 26 stored reports, 0 carry an `available`
flag, 26 of 26 hold a numeric projected value, and every capacity and
sensitivity block that exists holds numeric figures — nothing stored loses a
number, and no backfill was run. **`projectedMonthlyCashflow` is
typed `null` so it cannot be set**: projecting it needs a rent-growth and an
expense-growth assumption this repository does not have, and capital growth is
not rental growth. And **`formatCurrency(null)` returned `'$0'`**, so an
unavailable figure would have printed `$0/mo` — a rate shock of zero reads as
"rates rising costs you nothing", the exact inversion this work exists to end;
the KPI boxes distinguish "Not available" from "Not projected" now and draw the
reason beneath. **That component draws the block twice** — into the PDF and
again on screen, from the same object, through the same helper — and the first
attempt healed only the pdf-lib path, so the review a client is shown before
the document exists went on printing `$0/mo`. The invariant is stated over the
whole file for that reason, and an absent cashflow is no longer painted green
by `safeNumber(null) >= 0`.

**The label now says which quantity it is showing.** "IF RATES RISE +1%" is
true of both readings the corpus contains, which is exactly why it could sit
over either without looking wrong. A calculated row reads "+1%: MONTHLY CHANGE";
a historical row — one with no `available` flag — keeps the wording it shipped
with, because relabelling it would be a second guess about which quantity it
holds, and the point of this change is to stop guessing.

The tests deliberately do **not** assert that the +2% impact is twice the +1%.
That was an audit sanity band, not an invariant: a principal-and-interest
payment is convex in the rate. Six invariants pin the rest — no default term,
rate or structure exists to fill a gap with; no rate figure can reach the page
as a currency zero; the absence explanation is drawn on an explicit
`available === false` and never on a falsy check, so a historical row still
renders; the persisted paths both renderers read did not move; and the negative
sign convention is asserted in the type, in prose beside the field, and in the
arithmetic. Each was mutation-checked against the change it forbids.

## §39 — Stage 1: the record knows more than the report uses (2026-09-07)

Three defects on the primary report family, each found by executing the real
modules against the live corpus rather than by reading code, and each the same
shape: **a fact the record holds is not used, or a figure the record cannot
support is printed anyway.**

**A yield outlived the rent it rests on.** Run against
`Lot 2267 Hunza Road TRUGANINA`, whose `income` is null outright,
`composeFinancialChapters` produced a section headed *"Rental Assessment,
Gross Yield & Net Yield"*, strapline *"Recorded rental income and the yields it
produces"* — containing two yields and no income. The weekly and annual rows
had correctly suppressed themselves; the two figures computed FROM them had
not. **The absence discipline was applied to the inputs and not to what depends
on them**, which is the one arrangement that reads as a working page while
asserting a return on an income the record does not hold.

**Four readers print a yield**, and the fix is one rule they all ask:
`rentIsEstablished` in `rentalEvidence.pure.ts`, the module that already owns
the question. `financialChapters` (the FIN fork and condense), `toFinancial`
(WeasyPrint), `reportBindingProjection` (every bound template) and
`condenseFacts` (the block handed to the model) — the last of which is the
widest consequence, because an unfounded yield published there comes back as a
figure the model states as authoritative. A zero rent is deliberately NOT
establishment: `income.weeklyRent === 0` is the shape the original 0.00% defect
wrote, and admitting it would readmit every figure §37 removed. 16 stored
reports were in that state; a report that HAS a rent renders byte-identical,
asserted rather than assumed.

**The duty assessment ignored two things the request already told it.**
`financial-calculator-service` receives `borrowerType` — it picks the interest
rate with it — and then hardcoded `intent: 'owner_occupier'` for stamp duty. So
**143 stored reports that declare an investor were assessed on the
owner-occupier scale.** Measured against the canonical engine at the twelve
affected reports' own prices, QLD understates by **exactly $7,175** at every
price (its home concession is a flat rebate); ACT by $2,992, VIC by $3,100
below its $550k owner-occupier ceiling, and the other five states share one
scale so nothing moves. The second is `PropertyCategory`, which has always had
three values and every state schedule declares a `vacantLand` first-home
concession — the caller only ever computed `isNewBuild ? 'new' : 'established'`,
so those schedules were unreachable. That one is **latent, not realised**:
category affects first-home relief only, verified by execution across every
state and price for a non-FHB buyer with zero differences, and 0 stored reports
are FHB-eligible. Both are now derived from what the request carries.

**There were five property-type vocabularies in one flow.** The generator sent
the raw string to three services with a silent `|| 'house'`;
`overrides.pure.ts` normalised separately (`apartment` → `unit`, `villa` /
`duplex` → `townhouse`); the scoring service defends itself with its own
`apartment` branch and its own `|| 'house'`; and the prompt builds a sixth
"standardised" label by substring. The engine's only use of the type is
`strataFees = o.strataFees ?? (propertyType === 'unit' ? 4800 : 0)`, so
`apartment` never matched and never drew the strata estimate — **264 of 1,071
stored reports carry a type outside the engine's `house|unit|townhouse`
vocabulary.**

Three rules carry the fix. **One answer per request** —
`effectivePropertyType`, taken by the calculator, the validation service and
the scoring service. **`?? raw`, never `?? 'house'`** — a type that will not
resolve stays unresolved, because `residential property` matches no branch and
draws no adjustment, which is the honest neutral; defaulting it to a house
would have awarded the scoring service's `+3` house bonus to 145 reports nobody
has classified. And **the market rent lookup deliberately keeps the raw
string**, annotated at the site: it selects a published rent SERIES, so its
vocabulary is the market data's rather than the engine's, and mapping `villa`
onto `townhouse` there would change which rent is looked up.

Two things worth recording about the method. The realised exposure was
**smaller than the mechanism** in two of the three cases, and both times the
measurement corrected an earlier overstatement of mine — 81 land and
house-and-land reports carry no financial block at all, so the engine never
computed rent or residential duty on them (1 report did, `Mount Sylvia Road`,
$650/week on vacant land), and 29 of 32 apartments carry a body-corporate
override that supplies the real figure. And the spec caught **three call sites
I had missed** and the edge gate caught **a fatal redeclaration I introduced**,
which is what those gates are for.

## §40 — Stage 2: the renderer knew, and nobody asked (2026-09-07)

Stage 1 read the corpus as data. Stage 2 read one report as a **document** —
`28 Bligh Street, Muswellbrook NSW 2333`, 5 September, compass-40, the shape
the generator writes today — and the two defects worth fixing were both
already detected by code that exists.

**A render that loses content says nothing.** `renderMarkdown` returns a
complete degradation report: twenty-four notices covering truncation, rejected
and ragged tables, dropped columns, rows, list items, headings, images, glyphs
and figures, plus `degraded`. **Every caller throws it away.**
`reportBindingProjection`, `reportQaProjection`,
`marketIntelligenceProjection` and both converted-report renderers take
`.blocks`, `.html` or `.lines` and read no notice at all; the investment
renderer reads exactly **two of the twenty-four** (`figuresDrawn` /
`figuresDropped`) and discards the rest — including every one that means a
client's content did not reach the page.

On the Muswellbrook report a table row written
`… | General evidence only || Tenant stability …` — two rows concatenated by a
stray `||` — renders with `tablesRagged: 1` and **`tableColumnsDropped: 5`**,
and nothing anywhere is told. Across the corpus **12 reports carry that shape
and 118 carry an unterminated row**, out of 1,138 with tables.

`contentLosses` draws the line once: a notice that means content was **lost**
is a problem; a notice that means content was **transformed** is not.
`tablesLandscaped`, `listsFlattened`, `linksFlattened`,
`glyphsTransliterated`, `urlsNeutralised`, `listRunsMerged` and
`inlineSkipped` all keep the words, and reporting them would bury the ones that
do not. `tablesRagged` is likewise silent because the loss it causes is
counted separately as dropped columns — reporting both would double it. The
losses join the `problems` list the spine validation already populates and
count towards the `degraded` flag the plan already carried, so nothing new was
built: a chapter dropped for budget, prose cut for length and content the
markdown renderer could not carry are now the same kind of fact.

**Two services measure the same distance and both reach the report.** The
document says *"Muswellbrook Public School at 0.29 km"* and *"Pacific Brook
Christian School, is 0.46 km away"*. Its own stored
`location_intelligence.schools.topSchools` holds **0.21** and **0.42** for
those schools. Neither is the model inventing: `school-data-service` measures
its own distances and is interpolated into the prompt, while
`location-intelligence-service` measures them separately into the column that
is stored, projected and rendered. The model quotes the first; every
downstream surface reads the second.

The **stored** figure is the authority, because it is the one the record keeps.
`schoolDistance.pure.ts` replaces a prompt distance wherever the record names
the same school, and leaves a school the record does not name at the distance
it arrived with — a reconciliation rather than a filter, because dropping the
high school would lose a real fact to fix a disagreement it does not have.
Nothing here judges which service measures better; that is a separate question
about two great-circle implementations, and this one is only that a document
must not state a figure its own record contradicts.

**Three things this stage got wrong before it got them right.** A first render
harness ran without the production figure renderer and reported that both
charts were dropped and the Disclaimer heading discarded; wired as production
does, `figuresDrawn: 2`, `figuresDropped: 0`, `headingsDroppedEmpty: 0` — none
of it was real. The Sydney transport data in that report (Central Station,
450 m, on a property 292 km away) is **pre-fix**: the GTFS work landed two days
after it was generated. And the new spec caught a bug in the new module —
`St Joseph's` keyed as `st joseph s` and never matched `St Josephs`, which is
the one spelling difference these two services actually produce.

**What the corpus does well** is worth recording beside that. The prompt
carries `[School Name]` and `X.XX km` fallbacks and **not one of 1,180
completed reports contains either**; the walk score's distance fallback
correctly absorbs the new transport service's deliberate absence of a
`qualityScore`; and the renderer's detection is complete and accurate — it was
only ever unheard.

Two things are named and not fixed. Chart duplication is **8 of 45
chart-bearing reports (18%)**, worst three times, and the repeats are
*near*-identical — different dash characters, `3,120` against `3120` — which
is why the generator's own "render ONCE" instruction and any exact-match dedup
miss them. And **19 of 35 reports using `::: stat` (54%) draw at least one card
with a label, a unit, a sub-caption and no value.** Both wait on whether
surfacing the notices makes them self-evident first.

## §41 — Stage 3: the derived reports agree with the record, and with each other (2026-09-07)

Stage 3 of the staged validation programme — **Align Subsidiary / Derived
Reports**. The Compass family is one parent and four children:

| variant | engine | rows | producers (registry) |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| `compass` | `generate-investment-report` | 1,109 | 3 projection, 11 authored |
| `briefing` | condense (model) | 23 | 3 projection, 10 authored, **7 composed** |
| `snapshot` | condense (model) | 26 | 2 projection, **9 authored, 0 composed** |
| `financial` | fork (deterministic) | 11 | 2 projection, 9 routed, **8 composed** |
| `strategic` | fork (deterministic) | 11 | 2 projection, 16 routed, 1 composed |

### The corpus could not answer the question

**All 71 derived reports predate the code that produces them.** The
`condenseFacts` fix landed 2026-09-04 07:39:50; the newest child of any variant
is 2026-09-04 05:53:15. `reconcileFacts` landed 2026-09-02 and only **3**
compass reports have been generated since 2026-08-20.

So the stored documents testify about engines that no longer exist. Two figures
that looked like live defects — a briefing stating a score of 60 where the
record says 62, a snapshot stating five `/100` figures the record does not hold
— are pre-fix artefacts of exactly the defect `condenseFacts` was built to end.
Stage 3 was therefore done by **executing the current modules against real
parent rows**, chiefly `1/27D Mitchell Street` (`0478c410`).

### 1. One annual rent, and the basis it is stated on

`reportBindingProjection` published `annualRent = weeklyRent × occupancyWeeks`,
and `financialChapters.rentalAndYield` copied that derivation deliberately so
"this table and the verdict page's tiles state the same annual figure". They
did. Both disagreed with the **yield printed beside them**:

> | Weekly rent | $600 |
> | Annual rent (50 occupied weeks) | $30,000 |
> | Gross rental yield | 5.67% |

$30,000 ÷ $550,000 is 5.45%. The 5.67% is $31,200 ÷ $550,000 — the rent at 52
weeks. Two rows apart, in one four-row table, on the deterministic path.

What the record says, measured across the completed corpus:

| question | answer |
| --- | ---: |
| stored `income.annualRent` equals `weeklyRent × 52` | 18 of 18 |
| ... equals `weeklyRent × occupancyWeeks` | 0 of 18 |
| stored `grossRentalYield` rests on `weeklyRent × 52` | 149 of 153 |
| reports with `occupancyWeeks < 52` whose yield is still on 52 | 61 of 62 |

`rentBasis.pure.ts` is the one module that answers both questions and names
each: `contractual` (what a yield rests on, and what belongs beside a weekly
rent under a bare "p.a.") and `atOccupancy` (what the assumption expects to
collect), the latter present only when the report states an occupancy that is
not 52. The projection, the composed chapters and the recorded-facts block all
read it.

Effect on the corpus, computed over the 153 reports carrying a weekly rent, a
gross yield and a price:

| | before | after |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| published no annual rent at all | 27 | **0** |
| annual rent reconciles with the yield beside it | 64 | **149** |
| diverges | 62 | **4** |

The remaining 4 are records whose stored yield rests on neither basis. That is a
record-level inconsistency of the `healFinanceIdentity` family (§36), not
something this change introduced or can resolve.

### 2. The Snapshot was the only member of the family composing nothing

Briefing 7 sections from the record, Financial 8, Snapshot **0** — while four of
its nine model-authored sections were numeric. Its structure guide asked for:

```
## Investment Score
- Recommendation: [BUY/HOLD/SELL]

## Score Breakdown (simplified)
| Component | Score |
- Growth, Location, Yield, Demand, Risk
```

Two things are wrong with that, and both are the record contradicting the guide.

**The verdict vocabulary does not exist.** The engine issues `HOLD` (855
reports), `CAUTION` (99), `HOLD/BUY` (33) and `BUY` (2). `SELL` is never issued;
`CAUTION` is never offered; `HOLD/BUY` cannot be spelled in three words. A model
handed `HOLD/BUY - Moderate investment potential` and told to choose one of
three must change the recommendation to answer.

**The five components are not five.** The record marks a dimension it could not
score `excluded: true`, `weight: 0` and `hasData: false`, with a placeholder
`score` of 50 that is not a score. Both the projection and the composed briefing
section already withhold those correctly. The guide enumerated all five with no
omission rule — while the two sections either side of it had one — and the facts
block hands the model three. Exclusions are the **current** state rather than a
legacy rarity: 17 of 992 reports overall, but **16 of the 17 generated since
August 2026**.

`Investment Score`, `Score Breakdown` and `Financial Snapshot` are composed from
the record now and removed from the guide. `Key Market Stats` stays authored on
purpose: median price, vacancy rate, days on market and walk score are not in
`financial_calculations`, and composing it would mean inventing a source.

Two things the composed sections add that the guide could not ask for. The
ten-year projected value was in the guide's metric list and in **no** facts
block, so a model asked for it had to project one itself; it is read from
`projections.moderate` now. And the score's **partial coverage** is disclosed —
`InvestmentReportViewer` and `InvestmentGradeSummary` have always shown
`coverage.partialLabel` when `coverageRatio < 1`, so staff reading the record
were told the score rests on 3 of 5 dimensions and the client reading the
document was not.

### 3. Composed sections were appended, never placed

`trimToDeclaredSections` filters and has never reordered, and the composed
chapters were appended after everything the model wrote. So the Briefing's
financial tables, score breakdown and SWOT — registry orders 11–17 — printed
after `Recommendation` (20) and after `Market Data Sources` (90). Reproduced by
execution:

| before | after |
| --- | --- |
| … Top 3 Risks, Recommendation, Market Data Sources, **Purchase Costs**, Rental Assessment, Loan Structure, Sensitivity, 10-Year Cashflow, Investment Score Breakdown, SWOT | … Risk Overview, **Purchase Costs**, Rental Assessment, Loan Structure, Sensitivity, 10-Year Cashflow, Investment Score Breakdown, SWOT, Top 3 Opportunities, Top 3 Risks, Recommendation, Market Data Sources |

`tierAssembly.pure.ts` places every section at its declared order. It runs
**after** the trim rather than replacing it: the trim drops an undeclared
heading with its body, which is what stops a condensed report carrying the
parent's own 36 headings, while `partitionByRegistry` absorbs an unrecognised
heading into whichever section is open — right for reading a stored document,
wrong for enforcing a structure guide. A section it cannot place is appended and
**named** rather than dropped.

### Named and not fixed

**No child is fact-reconciled.** `reconcileFacts` has exactly one caller, the
parent generator, and 0 of 71 children carry a validation flag of any type (the
corpus holds `error`, `quality`, `structure` and `warning`; `fact` appears
nowhere, on any report, because only 3 parents postdate it). Composing the
snapshot's numeric sections removes the model's authority over the figures a
reconciliation would have checked, which is the stronger fix; extending the
detector to the children is the first candidate for the next stage, and it
should not be done until the detector has production mileage on the parent.

### Verification

Executed against the real parent row rather than a fixture: the composed rental
chapter, the three composed snapshot sections and both tiers' assembled section
order. 22 new tests. Two existing registry contracts were renegotiated
deliberately — the snapshot guide test now asserts it asks for exactly its
**authored** headings (the briefing's contract, and the stronger one, since it
also forbids the guide asking for a section we compose), and the producer
resolver learned two new shapes.

## §42 — Stage 4: a labelled block is a promise, and one correction (2026-09-07)

Stage 4 of the staged validation programme — **Rendering and Presentation
Validation**, carrying the three items Stage 2 named and deliberately left.

### The correction first

§40 recorded that "771 of 1,180 completed reports contain the firm's *general
informational purposes only* wording in the model's prose", and this programme
proposed stopping the prompt writing its own disclaimer. The count was right and
the reading of it was wrong.

Measured 2026-09-07: those 769 Compass reports carry the phrase at **93% of the
way through the document on average, and 729 of them in the last 10%** — inside
the disclaimer section, which is where a disclaimer belongs. It is not scattered
through the analysis. And it was **last produced 2026-07-21**: of the 10 reports
generated since August, zero contain it. The cohort is overwhelmingly December
2025 (663 of 686 that month).

The generator had already stopped doing the thing that was proposed to stop.

What is live is smaller and different. On the newest report (`28 Bligh Street,
Muswellbrook`, 5 Sep) the section reads:

```
### Disclaimer
{{glance: ◆ General information only | ⚠ Not tailored to your personal
  circumstances | ✓ Independent advice and due diligence are essential |
  ★ Use alongside professional financial, legal and tax guidance}}
```

A heading called "Disclaimer" whose entire body is a decorative chip strip,
while the operator's authored disclaimer (`global_report_settings.
professional_disclaimer`, enabled) is set on its own branded back page by
`render-investment-report-pdf`. That is a presentation question about a legal
statement on a client document — whether four chips are an acceptable rendering
of a disclaimer — and it is the operator's to answer, not this programme's. It
is named here and deliberately unchanged.

### 1. The stat card with no value

`::: stat` draws the largest single element on a page. Measured across the 24
Compass reports that use it: **23 of 71 cards (32%) carry a label, a unit and a
sub-caption and no value**, on 15 of those 24 reports. Verbatim:

```
::: stat label="Nearest station access" unit="m" sub="Muswellbrook Station from local transport references"

:::
```

The renderer draws `stat-value` unconditionally:

```ts
`<div class="stat-value">${esc(inner)}${unit ? `<span class="stat-unit">${unit}</span>` : ""}</div>`
```

So what a client receives is not a blank space. It is an oversized **"m"**, or
an oversized **"/100"**, set in display type with a caption underneath
explaining what it measures. **The unit becomes the statistic.**

A card with nothing to state is not drawn — not a dash, not a zero, not the unit
alone. A measured `0` is a statement and is kept.

### 2. The chart drawn twice

The generator's prompt tells it to render each figure once. 5 of the 26
chart-bearing reports since June repeat a directive anyway, 7 redundant draws in
all. The repeats are **near**-identical — a different dash character, `3,120`
against `3120` — which is why the prompt's own instruction and any exact-match
comparison both miss them. Normalisation is therefore the whole mechanism, and
it is deliberately narrow: case, whitespace, dash variants and thousands
separators. `{{bars: … 1-450}}` and `{{bars: … 1-451}}` remain two charts.

### Where it runs, and why in two places

`blockHygiene.pure.ts` holds both passes and one predicate. It is applied on the
**write** path — the parent's `compassPostProcessor` (phase 7, on the assembled
document, because a chart repeated across two sections is only visible once the
sections are one string again), plus condense and fork — and on the **read**
path, in the PDF renderer.

Both ends, because the write path alone leaves the 15 reports already carrying
an empty card, and those documents have been sent. That is the asymmetry
`healFinanceIdentity` settled on in §36 and for the same reason. `stripPlaceholderRows`,
the rule's existing enforcement on table rows, is called by condense and fork and
has never been called on a parent at all — which is how this class survived on
the Compass.

One predicate shared by both ends is load-bearing rather than tidy: the
renderer's fence pass is a plain `gm` regex with no code-fence awareness, so a
`::: stat` inside a ``` block IS drawn as a card today. The scrubber matches
exactly that set. A scrubber that were *smarter* than the renderer would leave a
card the renderer then draws as a bare unit. That behaviour of the renderer is
pre-existing and out of scope here; a test pins the agreement rather than the
behaviour.

### Named and not fixed

- **The Disclaimer sub-section**, above — the operator's call.
- **A bullet promising a continuation that never comes**: 5 occurrences across 5
  of 33 reports (`- **NSW Government and Muswellbrook Shire Council**` with a
  hard line break and then a blank line). Same family, small, and the fix is in
  the prompt rather than in a scrubber.

### Verification

- 12 new tests, executed against the verbatim production blocks
- `tsc --noEmit`, `security:edge-check` (339 against a 339 baseline) — clean

---

## §43 — Stage 4: reading the document, and who it says it is from (2026-09-08)

§42 fixed what a labelled block promises. This is the rest of Stage 4: the whole
document rendered through the **production** renderer and read page by page, and
then the same document rendered as an unbranded clone would produce it.

The harness imports `buildHtml` from `render-investment-report-pdf` itself and
feeds it a real `investment_reports` row (`6 Acer Court, Bowral NSW 2576`,
2026-09-02) plus the operator's real `global_report_settings`. Only
`loadHouseCoverArt` needs Supabase and it fails gracefully, so the HTML is the
production article. WeasyPrint **69.0** — the version the container pins —
turns it into the PDF. Fifteen pages, read as a document.

### Three chart defects, none of which a code review would have found

**1. The bar chart plotted dimensions the engine never scored.** Acer's
`investment_score.breakdown` marks `demand` and `growth` `excluded: true`,
`hasData: false`, `weight: 0` — and leaves a placeholder `score` of **50**
sitting in the field regardless. "Score drivers" drew five bars: risk 60,
yield 10, location 65, **demand 50, growth 50**. The two invented bars sit
mid-range between the three real ones, so the chart looks entirely normal.

Three readers ask that question and one asked nothing at all.
`reportBindingProjection` tests `excluded === true || hasData === false`;
`breakdownEntries` tests that plus a zero weight; the renderer's
`extractScoreBreakdownItems` read `.score` straight off the entry.
`dimensionWasScored` is the one predicate now, exported from
`scoreSections.pure.ts` and imported by the renderer. Re-rendered: five bars →
three.

**2. `&` printed as `&AMP;` on every chart label.** The Executive Verdict radar
read `&AMP; AMENITY`. `svgEscape` runs first and `.toUpperCase()` ran on its
output, so the entity's own letters were uppercased. The Contents page spells
the same heading correctly — that path decodes — which is why it survived.
`decodeHtmlEntities` / `svgLabel` / `svgLabelUpper` now carry the 15 label call
sites, and `&amp;` is decoded **last** so `&amp;lt;` cannot become `<`.

**3. The radar's longest label was clipped to `ASTRUCTURE`.** Labels anchor at
`cx ± (R + 22)` and ran outside a 460-wide viewBox. The box is 560 now — a
label gutter — with word-boundary wrapping at 15 characters and the score value
shifted down by the extra lines. Re-rendered: `INFRASTRUCTURE & AMENITY`, in
full, on two lines, clear of the polygon.

### An unbranded deployment signed its reports with another business's name

The same report rendered with the settings a freshly provisioned clone actually
holds — `contact_details.company_name` empty, no white-label brand, the seeded
`professional_disclaimer` row — carried **three businesses that are not the
issuer**, on one document:

| where | what it printed |
| --- | --- |
| watermark, tiled across every body page | `NPC` |
| PDF `Author` and `dcterms.creator` | `NPC Property` |
| back-page masthead | `PROPERTY` / `CONSULTING` |
| PDF `Creator` | `NPC Premium PDF (WeasyPrint)` |

`NPC` and `NPC Property` are the prime's trading name. `Property Consulting` is
a name no business holds — a placeholder that reads as a firm, and one of six
invented identities the fleet falls back to (`Property Consulting` ×14,
`Property Report` ×7, `NPC Property`, `NPC`, `a property advisory firm`,
`the Agency`).

The fourth copy is the one that matters most, and it was not in the renderer at
all. `useGlobalReportSettings.defaultDisclaimer` held the prime's own wording,
verbatim:

> *As a Professional Property Consultant & Buyers Agent, we provide information
> and advice based on our expertise… Our services include assisting you in
> identifying and evaluating potential opportunities, negotiating purchase
> terms, and navigating the transaction process… By engaging our services, you
> acknowledge…*

Under an unbranded masthead every clause of that is false. The platform is not
engaged by the reader, holds itself out as nobody's buyer's agent, and
negotiates nothing. It is not a cosmetic slip: acting as, or holding out as, a
real estate or buyer's agent is licensed conduct in every Australian state.

### The rule

**An identity and its disclaimer travel together**, because a disclaimer is a
statement by the issuer about the issuer. `issuerIdentity.pure.ts` resolves both
in one place, and there are exactly two issuers and never a third:

- **`workspace`** — the deployment has said who it is (report contact company
  name, or white-label brand). Its own name, its own disclaimer.
- **`platform`** — the deployment has said nothing. **Aurixa Systems**, and the
  technology provider's disclaimer.

No invented trading name, no other tenant's name, no blank masthead — the same
rule `platformBrand.ts` applies to the favicon and `submissionRecordBrand.ts`
to the AML submission record, and the "no brand" set is deliberately kept in
step with the latter so a document and its compliance record cannot disagree
about who issued them.

### Why the switch is on the READ and not on the default

Fixing the default alone would not have closed it. A clone whose
`global_report_settings` were seeded from the prime carries the prime's text in
the row, and no default ever fires. So `resolveReportDisclaimer` is keyed on the
resolved issuer, and the platform issuer prints the platform wording whatever is
stored.

The rule that makes that safe to state: *a deployment that has not said who it
is cannot have a disclaimer of its own.* A disclaimer written by an
unidentified party and printed under Aurixa's name is exactly the confusion this
closes, and the escape is one keystroke — typing a company name moves the whole
document to the `workspace` issuer.

`is_enabled: false` is honoured for a named business and **not** for the
platform: a report going out under Aurixa's name with no statement of what
Aurixa is would be the same defect reached by a different route.

### What the platform disclaimer says that the consultancy one could not

Five paragraphs, each closing something the inherited wording left open. Two are
worth naming.

**It disclaims the licensed CATEGORY, not merely the responsibility.** "Accepts
no responsibility" leaves the category claim standing, and the category claim is
the licensing one — so it says, in terms, that Aurixa Systems is not a real
estate agent, buyer's agent, property manager or licensed valuer, does not
provide financial product, credit, taxation or legal advice, and is not a party
to any property transaction. Stated as role and conduct rather than as a claim
about which registrations the company holds, because the licensing question
turns on what is *provided* and because this module cannot verify a corporate
registration.

**It does not extinguish the operator's own obligations.** A platform disclaimer
that appeared to wipe out a reader's rights against the business that handed
them the report would be a worse document than the one it replaces, so the
limitation carries its own limit: *"That does not limit the obligations of the
business that provided this report to you, whose own terms of engagement govern
its relationship with you."* The word "we" appears nowhere — "we" is what made
the consultancy wording read as an engagement.

The word **"Compass"**, the ten-year cash flow tables and the modelled
projections are all in the document, so the third paragraph says plainly that a
projection rests on stated assumptions and that *assumptions are not
predictions*.

### The back page, and a promise it could not keep

`CONTACT US` was drawn unconditionally over a contact list an unbranded
deployment has no rows for — a whole section heading over nothing, which is
§42's rule at page scale. It is drawn only when there is a row.

### Nothing changed for anyone who has a brand

The branded render, diffed before and after: **byte-identical** apart from the
generation timestamp, two source comments, and the `generator` meta — the tool
is Aurixa's rather than the prime's. The masthead, the contact rows, the
disclaimer body and the watermark are unchanged. The prime has held
`company_name: "Naidu Property Consulting Services"` since 2026-02-19, so
nothing here can reach its documents.

Verified on the unbranded render: **zero** occurrences of the string `NPC`
anywhere in the HTML (from 10), PDF `Author` = `Aurixa Systems`, masthead
`AURIXA` / `SYSTEMS`, no `CONTACT US` heading, the platform disclaimer on the
page.

### Named and not fixed

Found by reading the fifteen pages, all outside this package's scope:

- **Title and subtitle promoted to chapters** — Contents entries 02 and 03, and
  a near-blank page 5.
- **A WATCH callout truncated mid-word** at "finan".
- **Weekly cash flow reads −$1,844** in the document against a stored
  `weeklyNet` of −1,544.
- **The cover states the address twice.**
- **`1922` on the stat card, `1,922` in the prose** — one figure, two
  thousands conventions.
- **The cover's decorative SVG data-URI is rejected by WeasyPrint**, and
  `repeat(auto-fit/auto-fill)` is unsupported (4 warnings).
- **The disclaimer renders the source's hard line breaks** rather than
  reflowing.
- **`security-contract.test.ts` is wired into no script or workflow.** It was
  updated so it stays truthful, and `stage4ChartTruth.spec.ts` covers the same
  ground in a suite that does run — but a dormant contract test is a guard
  nobody is holding.
- **Five more invented-identity fallbacks outside the reporting engine** —
  `client-portal-login`, `portal-notification-email`, `manage-agency-agreements`
  and `_shared/brand-config.ts`, the last of which also falls back to the
  prime's own `@npcservices.com.au` sender addresses with a stated reason
  (a verified Resend sender). Same class, different surface.

### Verification

## §44 — The scorecard is bars, not a radar (2026-09-08)

Rugesh rejected the Executive Verdict's radar outright on sight of the §43
render. It is removed rather than discouraged.

### Two of the objections are about the data, not about taste

**The polygon's area depends on the arbitrary order of the axes.** The same
five scores arranged differently enclose a different area and read as a
different result. Nothing in `investment_score.breakdown` says what the order
should be — it is object key order — so the chart's most visually dominant
property carried no information at all.

**Area scales with the square of the values.** A dimension at 86 beside one at
64 contributes roughly 1.8× the area rather than 1.34×, so the picture
overstated every gap it drew.

Two more follow from the form. The space between two spokes means nothing —
there is no continuum between "tenant appeal" and "risk profile" — and filling
it implies one. And comparing lengths along five spokes at five angles is
measurably harder than comparing them against one baseline, while the corner
labels crowd: §43's `ASTRUCTURE` clipping was a symptom of the geometry, and
the gutter-and-wrap that fixed it is what a radar needs merely to be legible.

Bars close all four at once: one baseline, length proportional to value,
nothing enclosed, labels set horizontally in a column that sizes itself.

### Removed, not deprecated

`renderScoreWheel` (design system, ~6.7 KB of radar geometry) and
`renderScoreWheelSvg` (investment renderer) are **deleted**. A dormant
renderer is one import away from coming back — the reasoning that deleted
`ResponsibilityNotice.tsx` rather than unmounting it. `renderScoreBars` and
`renderScoreBarsSvg` replace them, both delegating to the `renderBars`
primitive that already existed beside them.

**The directive vocabulary is unchanged.** `{{wheel: …}}` is still recognised
and still draws, because ~35 stored reports emit it and dropping it would
blank a figure on every one. Content is transformed, never lost — and the
minimum score count drops from three to two, because three was the radar's
constraint (a polygon needs three vertices; bars do not).

The generator prompt now names the section SCORECARD and says in terms that it
is drawn as horizontal bars and never as a radar or spider chart.

Zero of 112 `report_templates` carry a `chart-radar` or `score-wheel` block, so
no stored template changes. The Template Builder still *offers* `chart-radar`
in its block palette — a separate product surface, named here and not touched.

### Two things the change surfaced

**The entity bug came back in a new form.** Moving the scorecard onto
`renderBarsSvg` printed `Infrastructure &amp; amenity`: labels arrive from
prose `marked` has already escaped, and `svgEscape` ran on them a second time.
Latent on `{{bars:}}` — no production bar label had ever carried an ampersand —
and immediate the moment the scorecard landed on that primitive. Fixed at the
primitive with §43's own `svgLabel`, so `{{bars:}}` gets it too.

**Two bar charts of the same kind must not be coloured by different rules.**
The document now draws two: Figure 01 "Score drivers" (the composite's
weighted dimensions) and Figure 02 "Qualitative scorecard". `renderBarsSvg`'s
default ramp colours by magnitude and turns **green** (`VIZ_GOOD`, `#4F7A33`)
above 0.66 — a colour this gold-and-cream document uses nowhere else, and one
that would have painted four of the scorecard's five dimensions. Both charts
pass an explicit gold accent and let the bar lengths do the comparing, which is
the entire argument for bars. Score drivers' labels also moved to sentence case:
`dimensionLabel`'s lowercase is for PROSE ("weighted across growth, location and
yield") and read as a typo in a label column beside "Location strength".

### Not sorted, deliberately

Bars can be sorted without distortion — there is no enclosed area whose shape
depends on order — and a sorted scorecard answers "which dimension is weakest"
instantly. It is left in the record's order for two reasons: the breakdown
table directly beneath it uses that order, and two orders on facing content is
a real cross-referencing cost; and the order is stable across reports, so a
reader comparing two properties finds the same dimension in the same row.

### Verification

- Rendered end-to-end and read: the scorecard prints five bars on one baseline,
  every label whole, `Infrastructure & amenity` correct, zero `&amp;` anywhere
  in the document
- The label guard MOVED rather than being deleted — `reportRenderDefects.spec`
  still asserts a long dimension label prints whole, now against the chart that
  replaced the radar, plus a measured ink-fits-the-column assertion
- A source guard asserts no radar renderer survives on either path, and that
  the directive still draws
- `vitest run` — 21,938 passed, 0 failed; `tsc`, `eslint`, `build`,
  `audit:style`, `security:edge-check` at baseline — clean

---

## §45 — Stage 5: the record must hold what the document asserts (2026-09-08)

Stage 5 asks whether the pipeline is right across the range of properties the
business actually sees. Doing that naively — render five more reports and read
them — is Stage 4 five times, so the space was derived from what the pipeline
genuinely **forks on** and the live corpus was counted into it.

The first measurement changed the question. **The range has collapsed.**

### `property_specs` is a hardcoded string and eight nulls

Every one of the 68 reports generated since June 2026 carries
`property_specs.property_type = 'Residential Property'` and **null in every
other field** — no bedrooms, no land size, no build size, no parking, no year
built, no zoning, no council area. `1/27D Mitchell Street` is unmistakably a
unit and its record says nothing. `6 Acer Court` is a four-bedroom house on
1,922 m² and its record says nothing.

Except the record does know. All of it is in `manual_overrides`:
`propertyType: "house"`, `landSizeSqm: 1922`, `buildSizeSqm: 253`,
`carSpaces: 2`.

The generator resolves every one of those correctly — `effectiveLandSizeSqm`
and its siblings merge the overrides over the listing, and those merged values
build the prompt, the duty assessment and the score — and then persists the
**un-merged half**:

```ts
land_size_sqm: propertyDetails?.landSizeSqm || null,
property_type: standardizedPropertyType || propertyDetails?.propertyType || 'Residential Property',
```

The answer is computed, used, and discarded at the moment of writing it down.
Measured across the completed corpus:

| the operator supplied | the spec column stored |
| --- | ---: |
| `landSizeSqm` | null on **127** |
| `buildSizeSqm` | null on **122** |
| `carSpaces` | null on **144** |
| `propertyType` | the literal on **84** |

`'Residential Property'` is not a measurement. `normalisePropertyType` returns
undefined for it, `dRisk` tests `unit|apartment|townhouse|house` and hits none,
`financialEngine` tests `=== 'unit'` for the strata estimate and misses. It is
a placeholder that reads as a classification — the same class as a `0.00%`
yield standing in for an unknown rent.

### Two rules

**The record must hold what the document asserts.** `composePropertySpecs`
takes the merged facts; every field is `| null` and a caller that knows nothing
writes nulls, which is a true statement about the record.

**Reading heals as well as writing.** Fixing the write alone would leave all
1,180 stored reports with an empty spec block for ever while the facts sit in
`manual_overrides` on every one of them. `readPropertyFacts` resolves the spec
column first and falls back to the overrides — the asymmetry
`healFinanceIdentity` settled on, for the same reason: a read-path repair
reaches every reader with no migration and no stored byte overwritten.

### The fork read four keys and three had never been written

`fork-investment-report` built its score input from
`parent.property_specs?.price`, `?.weeklyRent`, `?.state` and `?.propertyType`.
The writer has only ever emitted `land_size_sqm`, `building_size_sqm`,
`bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `parking`, `year_built`, `property_type`, `zoning`,
`council_area`. Three of the four names do not exist and the fourth is the
writer's `property_type` misspelled.

This is the `aml.cases.tenant_id` class in JSONB, where **nothing errors**: the
read yields `undefined`, `Number(undefined)` yields `NaN`, and the `||` chain
silently takes the next rung.

Realised exposure, measured rather than assumed: `price` and `weeklyRent` are
shadowed by working rungs above them, so they cost nothing. `propertyType`
resolved to the placeholder while the operator's own answer sat in `overrides`,
destructured two lines above. `dRisk` is its only consumer and is weighted 15%
on the financial fork, 5% on the composite and **absent from
`DUE_DILIGENCE_WEIGHTS`** — so the strategic fork is unaffected, and my first
hypothesis that it moved every fork was wrong. Executed against a real parent:
a unit grades **B at 60 where the record says C+ at 57**. There are 19
apartments in the corpus and **none has ever been forked**, so this is latent —
and armed, and in the inflating direction.

### The prompt instructed the fabrication

`Property Characteristics` supplied the model a fill-in-the-blank on six rows:

```
| Land Size | ${effectiveLandSizeSqm ? … : 'Estimated XXX-XXX m² (typical for suburb)'} |
| Bedrooms  | ${effectiveBeds  || 'X (typical for property type)'} |
| Parking   | ${propertyDetails?.carSpaces || 'X-X spaces'} |
| Condition | ${propertyDetails?.condition || 'Good to excellent'} |
```

**169** stored documents print an `Estimated N–N m²` land size and **201**
assert `| Condition | Good to excellent |` about a property nobody inspected.
Three sampled reports state a land size roughly **double** the operator's own
recorded figure and then reason from it: `38 Larcom Crescent` says `~500 m²`
throughout — council rates, land tax and rent comparables — against a recorded
**255**. `80 Alison Street` prints `Estimated 500-650 m²` against a recorded
450. The prose is a literal expansion of the prompt's placeholder; the model
did exactly what it was told.

Era-split, because the mechanism and the exposure are different questions:

| era | reports | `Estimated N–N m²` | `Condition: Good to excellent` |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| since Jun 2026 | 68 | **0** | **0** |
| Mar–May 2026 | 40 | 2 | 14 |
| before Mar 2026 | 1,072 | 167 | 187 |

So it is **historical** — the Compass-40 overlay does not draw that section.
A broader regex initially matched 14 current reports; read, all fourteen are
legitimate qualitative prose ("crime levels are moderate and broadly typical
for a coastal residential suburb"), which is a measurement error of mine and
not a finding. The placeholders are removed anyway, because a dormant
instruction to fabricate is one routing change from firing — the reasoning that
deleted the radar rather than deprecating it.

A prohibition with no permitted action is one a model routes around, so the
rows are omitted and the permitted action is stated: it may say an attribute is
not recorded, and may discuss the suburb's stock provided it attributes none of
it to this property.

### Coverage, per era

What fraction of the document's promised facts the record can actually
produce, reading spec **or** override:

| fact | historical (1,112) | current (68) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| property type | 88% | 57% |
| land size | 8% | 54% |
| build size | 8% | 49% |
| purchase price | 38% | 72% |
| weekly rent | 14% | 72% |
| investment score | 87% | **37%** |
| coordinates | 95% | **59%** |

Operators entering overrides have lifted land and build coverage sixfold. The
two that fell are worth their own work: 63% of current reports carry no score
at all, so the Executive Verdict scorecard draws nothing on most of them, and
41% have no coordinates, so no map.

### Verification

- 18 new tests; the phantom-key guard proved **red on the bug and green on the
  fix** rather than assumed
- The scorer executed against a real parent to measure the fork's cost, which
  corrected my own hypothesis about which variants it reaches
- `vitest run` full suite green; `tsc`, `eslint`, `audit:style`,
  `security:edge-check` at its 339 baseline

## §46 — Evidence-Backed Scoring: what market data this platform actually has (2026-09-08)

Step 1 of the Evidence-Backed Scoring brief is to trace the real Cotality
entitlement and every other authoritative market source, on the instruction not
to assume a vendor's public field list is what this application is entitled to.
It is a gate: the Growth Evidence Layer cannot be built on a source that returns
nothing.

**There is no capital-growth evidence in this platform.** Both candidate
sources are traced below, and neither has ever delivered a value.

### Cotality / CoreLogic — scaffolding, never connected

`supabase/functions/cotality-service/index.ts` says so in its own header:
*"SCAFFOLDING ONLY. Status: awaiting sandbox credentials from Cotality."* While
`COTALITY_API_KEY` is unset every branch returns a `modelled` envelope with
`value: null` and confidence 0.3.

Measured rather than taken on trust:

| check | result |
| --- | ---: |
| `data_provenance` rows (where the envelope would persist) | **0** |
| `cotality_*` / `corelogic_*` tables | **none exist** |
| calls in `api_usage_log` (7 months, 20 services) | **0** |
| callers of `cotality-service` anywhere in the repo | **0** |

The only references outside the function are three comments in
`investment-scoring-service` — `cotalityReady: true`, *"when cotality-service
envelopes land"*. It is a placeholder for an integration that was never
completed.

### Domain — wired, called, and returns nothing

`domain-data-service` is real code against a real endpoint:

```
https://api.domain.com.au/v1/suburbPerformanceStatistics/{state}/{suburb}
  ?propertyCategory={house|unit}&chronologicalSpan=12&tPlusFrom=1&tPlusTo=12
```

Its declared `SuburbPerformance` is close to exactly what the Growth and Demand
dimensions need — `medianSoldPrice`, `numberSold`, `medianRentListingPrice`,
`numberRented`, `daysOnMarket`, `auctionClearanceRate`, `annualGrowth`,
`rentalYield` — at suburb + state + dwelling-type granularity. It **is** called
by `generate-investment-report` (guarded on `suburb && state`).

And it has never returned a value. The generator's own provenance record is the
proof, because it stamps every source it attempted:

```
"seifa":     { source: abs_seifa,   confidence: 0.9  }
"economics": { source: rba,         confidence: 0.9  }
"employment":{ source: abs_employment, confidence: 0.9 }
"crimeStatistics": { source: state_crime_data, confidence: 0.8 }
"locationIntelligence": { source: google_maps, confidence: 0.95 }
"marketData": null                          ← the only null
```

46 of the 68 reports since June carry the `marketData` key; **0 of 68 carry a
non-null value**, and `demographics_data.marketData.medianPrice`,
`.annualGrowth`, `.vacancyRate` and `.daysOnMarket` are absent on **all 992**
scored reports.

**Absence from `api_usage_log` is not the evidence here**, and saying so would
repeat a mistake this programme has already made twice: `domain-data-service`
uses a bare `fetch` rather than `meteredFetch`, so a working call would not
appear there either. What is evidence is that it writes nothing to
`api_health_log` while six sibling services do, which matches the code path
where `DOMAIN_API_KEY` is unset — that branch returns `dataQuality:
'unavailable'` *before* any fetch or logging.

So the distinction that matters commercially: **this is most likely a missing
credential, not a missing capability.** Domain's Suburb Performance
Statistics product would supply most of the Growth and Demand layer. That is a
procurement question, not an engineering one, and it should be settled before
any further scoring work.

### What the platform DOES hold

| source | rows | what it can evidence |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `abs_sa2_population` | **61,335** (2001–2025, 2,454 SA2s) | population growth at 1/3/5/10-year horizons, real CAGR |
| `rba_observations` | 3,518 | macro rate and lending series |
| `abs_census_poa` | 2,643 | income, tenure, household composition |
| `abs_seifa_poa` | 2,627 | socio-economic advantage deciles |
| `suburb_directory` | 18,519 | geography resolution |
| `median_rent_cache` | 156 (38 suburbs) | rents, thin |

Every one of these is a **growth driver**, not capital growth. Under the
brief's own §2 distinction — *"population growth is not itself evidence that
property values have grown"* — the platform can currently evidence the
supporting half of the Growth dimension and **none of the primary half**.

### The consequence for scoring

A Growth dimension built only on population, SEIFA and macro series would be
labelled Capital Growth while measuring none of it. That is the same class of
defect as the placeholder 50 it replaces — a dimension asserting more than its
evidence supports — and it would fail the brief's own test of surviving a
client challenge.

Scoring V2 therefore stops here, unwired, pending a decision on the market-data
source. The arithmetic corrections are built and backtested (§45); what is
missing is the evidence, and no amount of engineering substitutes for it.

---

## §47 — The wire is cut in four places, and the ABS answers (2026-09-08)

§46 stopped at "there is no market-data credential" and put a procurement
question to the owner. That was the right gate and the wrong stopping point:
following the payload the rest of the way to the scorer shows that **restoring
a credential would not have moved a single score**, and probing the public
registers shows that the primary evidence the brief demands is available for
nothing.

### Part 1 — Four independent breaks between market data and a grade

Each is fatal on its own. Each reports as normal operation.

**1. No credential.** `domain-data-service` reads `DOMAIN_API_KEY` and returns
HTTP 500 `Domain API key not configured` before any fetch. It is alone among
its siblings in writing no `api_health_log` row — `abs-census` (2,441),
`climate-data` (2,289), `crime-statistics` (1,747), `public-transport` (639),
`bc-segment-engine` (194) and `risk-assessment` (172) all do, Domain has never
written one. Consistent with the unset branch; not proof of it, because the
function logs health only after a successful call.

**2. The payload never reaches the scorer.** This is the break that matters.
`generate-investment-report` stores the Domain response as
`enhancedData.domainData` — a **sibling** of `demographics` — and then calls
the scorer with:

```ts
body: JSON.stringify({
  property: { … },
  demographics: enhancedData.demographics,
  locationIntelligence: enhancedData.locationIntelligence,
  financials: enhancedData.financials
})            // ← domainData is not here, and never has been
```

while every scorer reads

```ts
const marketData = demographics.marketData || financials.marketData || {};
```

— `investment-scoring-service` (twice: `transformScoringInput` and
`transformAreaInput`), `_shared/investmentScoreEngine.ts`, and
`backfill-investment-scores`. **No writer anywhere in the repository writes
`marketData` under either key.**

Measured across the whole corpus on 2026-09-08:

| assertion | result |
| --- | ---: |
| reports stored | 1,199 |
| distinct keys ever present in `demographics_data` | **7** — `dataQuality`, `dataSource`, `population`, `employment`, `income`, `housing`, `cached` |
| `demographics_data ? 'marketData'` | **0** |
| `financial_calculations ? 'marketData'` | **0** |
| `data_sources->'marketData'` populated | **0** of 1,049 carrying the key |

So `marketData` has evaluated to `{}` on every report this platform has ever
generated, and `medianSuburbPrice`, `priceGrowth1Year`, `priceGrowth3Year`,
`vacancyRate` and `daysOnMarket` have been `undefined` every time. This is the
`aml.cases.tenant_id` class again — reading a name no writer writes, with
nothing to report it — except in JSONB, where there is not even a 42703.

**3. A name mismatch behind the disconnect.** Were the payload routed, Domain
returns `medianSoldPrice`; the scorer reads `marketData.medianPrice`.
`annualGrowth` and `daysOnMarket` would map; the median would not.

**4. The series is fetched and thrown away.** The request asks for twelve
windows (`chronologicalSpan=12&tPlusFrom=1&tPlusTo=12`) and the handler keeps

```ts
series.seriesInfo[series.seriesInfo.length - 1]
```

— one point. So even a live, routed, correctly-named integration yields **one**
growth horizon, where the brief's §3 requires 5-year, 3-year, 1-year and a
consistency reading. And two fields the scorers want are not in the declared
`SuburbPerformance` interface at all: `priceGrowth3Year` and `vacancyRate`.

**The conclusion the credential question was hiding:** breaks 2–4 are ours, they
are free to fix, and until they are fixed no market-data purchase can change a
grade.

### Part 2 — The primary evidence is public, and it was measured

Probed live from this egress on 2026-09-08 (single range requests, no crawl):

| source | result |
| --- | --- |
| ABS Data API (`data.api.abs.gov.au`) | **answers** |
| VIC / QLD / SA open-data portals (CKAN) | answer |
| NSW Valuer General bulk sales | blocked at this proxy (502 CONNECT) — re-probe from the Supabase egress, as G2 did |

Two ABS dataflows carry property values. **`RPPI`** (Residential Property Price
Index) returns nothing after **2021-Q4** — five years stale, and a reminder of
the sanctions rule that *freshness of the load is not currency of the data*.
**`RES_DWELL`** is current and is the answer:

> **`ABS,RES_DWELL` — Residential Dwellings: Unstratified Medians and Transfer
> Counts by Dwelling Type, GCCSA and Rest of State**
>
> - 4 measures: transfer **counts** and **median prices**, each split
>   *established houses* vs *attached dwellings*
> - 15 regions (8 Greater Capital Cities + 7 Rest-of-State), plus state and
>   two weighted averages in the codelist
> - **2002-Q1 → 2026-Q2**, 98 quarters, 60 series, 92–98 observations each
> - medians are `AUD` at `UNIT_MULT=3`; counts are `NUM` at `0`

Executed end to end, median price of established house transfers, growth to
2026-Q2, annualised:

| region | median | 1yr | 3yr p.a. | 5yr p.a. | 10yr p.a. |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Greater Sydney | $1,488,000 | −2.13% | 3.16% | 4.28% | 5.21% |
| Rest of NSW | $810,000 | 5.06% | 4.49% | 6.54% | 6.66% |
| Greater Melbourne | $850,000 | 1.19% | 0.38% | 0.48% | 3.37% |
| Rest of Vic. | $625,000 | 8.70% | 3.12% | 5.49% | 7.44% |
| Greater Brisbane | $1,155,000 | 18.83% | 14.22% | 12.89% | 8.84% |
| Rest of Qld | $800,000 | 10.10% | 12.62% | 10.76% | 6.53% |
| Greater Adelaide | $975,000 | 13.24% | 11.57% | 12.13% | 8.28% |
| Rest of SA | $584,000 | 15.74% | 13.95% | 13.52% | 8.23% |
| Greater Perth | $1,010,000 | 18.82% | 18.96% | 13.34% | 6.86% |
| Rest of WA | $665,000 | 20.91% | 18.46% | 11.90% | 7.26% |
| Greater Hobart | $750,000 | 4.90% | 2.50% | 3.55% | 7.47% |
| Rest of Tas. | $625,000 | 13.64% | 5.32% | 8.27% | 9.47% |
| Greater Darwin | $752,000 | 21.37% | 8.45% | 5.90% | 3.22% |
| Rest of NT | $450,000 | 1.28% | −1.99% | −0.44% | 0.55% |
| ACT | $1,030,000 | 3.00% | 1.57% | 2.62% | 5.16% |

This is capital growth in the brief's own sense — **actual value movement**,
measured, government-published, dwelling-type aware, and reproducible by anyone
issuing the same request. It discriminates: Greater Perth and Greater Melbourne
are twenty points apart on the three-year reading, where today both score 50.
The transfer counts on the same dataflow are a genuine turnover signal for the
Demand dimension.

Two limits travel with it, and must be recorded on every figure rather than
argued away:

- **It is unstratified.** A raw median of transfers, not quality-adjusted, so
  composition shifts move it. The ABS says so in the dataflow's own title.
- **The grain is regional, not suburb** — Greater Sydney, Rest of NSW. Under
  the brief's §9 (persist the geographical level) and §8 (evidence confidence)
  that is exactly what the design already anticipates: a coarse measure,
  labelled coarse, beats a placeholder 50 and beats a fabricated suburb figure.
  It is a floor to build on, not a ceiling — suburb-grain sales registers are
  the next layer, and NSW's needs re-probing from the Supabase egress.

### What this changes

The gate in §46 asked the owner to choose a vendor. The measurement says the
first move needs no vendor and no spend: route the market payload to the
scorer, fix the field names, keep the series, and stand a deterministic Growth
dimension on `RES_DWELL`. A vendor purchase remains the route to *suburb*
grain, vacancy and days-on-market — but it is now an improvement on a working
dimension rather than the precondition for having one.

Scoring V2 stays unwired, per the brief's §14.

---

## §48 — Backtesting the ABS growth layer: it works, and that is the problem (2026-09-08)

§47 found a real, free, authoritative capital-growth source and recommended
standing the Growth dimension on it. Requirement 12 of the brief says to
backtest before wiring. Doing so changes the recommendation, and the reason is
one the brief anticipated in its own §8.

Method: the 992 scored reports, `scoringV2.pure.ts` **unmodified**, with
`priceGrowth1Year` and `priceGrowth3Year` supplied from `ABS,RES_DWELL` for
the report's state and dwelling type. Reads only; nothing written.

### The grade becomes a statement about the state

| state | n | growth subscore | composite min | median | max | spread |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| WA | 71 | **100** | 73 | **90** | 98 | 25 |
| QLD | 52 | **100** | 66 | 82 | 91 | 25 |
| VIC | 56 | 44 | 45 | 54 | 59 | 14 |
| NSW | 13 | 35 | 46 | 53 | 55 | 9 |

Growth carries 0.40 of the nominal weight and **every property in a state
receives the identical figure**, so the within-state spread is 9–25 points
while the between-state swing is 55. Under this layer the median Perth
property is an **A+** and no Sydney property can reach **A** at all, whatever
its merits.

That fails the brief's own test. "Why is my property A+?" answered with
"Greater Perth median house prices rose 18.8% last year" is a statement about
Perth. "Why is mine C+?" answered with "Greater Sydney fell 2.1%" is a
statement about Sydney. Neither is a defence of a grade awarded to a property.

### Every A+ in that run is a renormalisation

| the A/A+ cohort (119 of 216 resolvable) | |
| --- | --- |
| graded on 4 of 5 dimensions | 73 |
| graded on **3 of 5** | 46 |
| `weightCovered` values observed | **0.60, 0.70, 0.85** — never 1.00 |

So not one A+ here rests on the full nominal evidence; each is ≤85% of it
renormalised to 100%. Requirement 8 forbids precisely this — *"Do not simply
renormalise 45% of evidence to 100% and allow an A+"* — and the backtest shows
the gate is load-bearing rather than decorative. Arithmetic that renormalises
correctly is still not a defensible grade when what it renormalises is thin.

### A third finding, from the resolution attempt

Only **216 of 992** reports could be resolved to a state from
`property_address`, and the reason is not a parsing weakness: **743 of the 776
unresolved carry no comma at all** — `6 Acer Court`, `1/27D Mitchell Street`,
`Parmelia`, `The Glengarry Hotel (The Glen Pub)`. Bare street lines with no
suburb, no state, no postcode.

But 967 of 992 carry `location_intelligence.coordinates`. So the geography is
recoverable, from the coordinate and never from the address string — and the
join is already in the database: `abs_sa2_meta.gccsa_name` carries all fifteen
region names **exactly** as `RES_DWELL` spells them ("Greater Sydney", "Rest of
Vic.", "Australian Capital Territory"), so no correspondence needs inventing.
Any growth layer must be keyed on the resolved coordinate.

### What this changes

The ABS layer is worth having and is not the Growth dimension. Three
conclusions:

1. **`RES_DWELL` belongs in the product as regional CONTEXT**, labelled as the
   region's movement and carrying its own weight, never presented as this
   property's capital growth.
2. **Suburb-grain evidence is genuinely required** for a property-level growth
   score that survives a client challenge. That is now measured rather than
   asserted, and it is the case for the purchase §47 said was optional.
3. **The evidence-confidence gate comes first, whatever the source.** On this
   corpus it is the difference between a grade and a renormalisation, and no
   data purchase substitutes for it.

Scoring V2 stays unwired.
