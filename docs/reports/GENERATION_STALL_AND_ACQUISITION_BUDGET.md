# The run that did nothing for 21 minutes, and why nothing said so

**Incident:** 19 Sep 2026, 18 Annabelle Crescent, Kellyville NSW 2155, purchase
input A$1,490,000. The progress widget read
`Section 1 of 15 · 0/15 · 0% · 21m 2s elapsed · 2 auto-retry attempts used`.

Three defects were true at once. Each on its own is sufficient to produce that
screen, and each reported as normal operation — which is the part worth
remembering, because it is the same shape as the AML screening incident and the
`market_sources` seeding gap: **every signal was green and none of them was
measuring the thing that had stopped.**

## 1 · Acquisition had no deadline

The acquisition block (`generate-investment-report/index.ts`, the `try` that
opens after the crime-postcode resolution and closes ~1,500 lines later) issued
**eight service calls**. Seven were a plain `fetch` with no `AbortSignal` at
all. The eighth used the file's own `fetchWithTimeout` at its **90-second
default**.

The run they sit inside is bounded:

| constant | value | what it bounds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SECTION_CALL_HARD_STOP_MS` | 125 s | last moment a model call may be in flight, from the run's start |
| `SECTION_MIN_CALL_WINDOW_MS` | 20 s | below this a section is not attempted at all |
| platform kill | ~150 s | the edge runtime's own ceiling |

`runStartedAt` is taken **before** acquisition, so acquisition spends the same
clock the sections need. Past roughly 105 s elapsed there is no window for even
one section, and the loop returns `SECTION_BUDGET_DEFERRED` — correctly
reported as a hand-off rather than a failure, because no call was made.

So one slow provider consumed the invocation, every time, and the document
never started.

**The fix is not a shorter constant.** Every acquisition call now answers to the
run's own clock through `acquisitionFetch`, which delegates to the existing
`fetchWithTimeout` so the circuit breaker still applies — one fetch wrapper, not
two. The window is whatever remains after reserving enough for one model call
*and* enough to persist what research did land. Ceilings are per dependency
class (`local` 8 s, `vendor` 12 s, `register` 20 s, `archive` 25 s) and are
ceilings only: the run's clock always wins, so a generous ceiling cannot
overrun the invocation.

### The rule that matters most here

**A timeout is not evidence of absence.**

A register that did not answer in time has told us nothing about the property. A
register that answered and held nothing has told us something real and worth
printing. `AcquisitionOutcome` keeps `answered` / `timeout` / `http_error` /
`transport_error` / `not_attempted` apart by construction, and `describesSubject`
is true for exactly one of them.

When no window remains the call is **not made** and returns a synthetic `598`,
so every call site's existing `!response.ok` branch records a **failure** rather
than an empty answer. That is the conservative side: we did not ask, so the
dependency stays outstanding for the next invocation instead of being written
into the record as an absence. Getting this backwards is how
"no flood overlay was returned in 4 s" becomes "this property has no flood
overlay" in a client's document — the same class as
[`ABSENCE_IS_NEVER_RATED`](./PLANNING_CONTROLS_IN_THE_REPORT.md) §9 and the
Places `count: 0` defect in [`RF72B1B1`](./RF72B1B1_ENRICHMENT_AND_POSTCODE.md) §13.

## 1a · The first fix bound a third of the calls

Worth recording, because the shape of the mistake is the point: **the fix was
written from the calls I had found, not from the calls that exist.** Reading the
*deployed* bundle back afterwards is what showed the rest.

Measured on the deployed revision (`generate-investment-report` v417):

| | calls | timeout allowance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bound to the run clock | 7 | the run's own |
| **not** bound | **14** | **290 s** |

Of the fourteen, nine sat after phase 1 and were awaited **one after another** —
45 s planning + 40 s climate + 30 s regional + 30 s Domain + 25 s risk + three
crime asks at 20 s — summing to 260 s of ceiling. The phase-1 wave adds up to
30 s more. The invocation's whole hard stop is **125 s**.

So the incident was never closed by the first release: one slow register could
still spend the run on its own, and the document would still never start. Every
call in the acquisition region now goes through `acquisitionFetch`, and the site
keeps **its own declared ceiling** rather than being clamped to a class default
— a planning register that needs 45 s still asks for 45 s, and the run's clock
takes the smaller of the two. Buying speed by shortening a register's patience
would be buying it with evidence.

The guard is derived rather than listed. The first version of the spec named six
services by hand and passed with those fourteen calls in place, which is exactly
the failure mode: **a hand-list cannot see the call it does not mention.** The
spec now reads every `functions/v1/…` call out of the generator's source and
requires each one to be on the bounded wrapper, and it is mutation-tested.

### And a non-answer was being recorded as an absence

Converting phase 1 exposed a second fault in the same class, older than this
work. Those wrappers read `if (response.ok) { … } return null`, and a null there
reaches `fetchServiceWithFallback` as the string `"No data returned"`, which
`acquisitionLedger.fromServiceResult` maps to `unavailable_in_coverage` —
*"the provider answered and holds nothing for this subject"*. So an HTTP 500
from the ABS service was already being written into the record as a statement
about the property. `assertAcquisitionAnswered` throws instead, which lands in
the same wrapper's catch and records `requested_failed`. `return null` still
means what it always meant: the service answered 200 and said it holds nothing,
which is real and worth printing.

---

## 1b · One wave, not four queues

Planning, climate, regional trends and Domain depend on the geography that has
just resolved and on **nothing else**. They were awaited in series, so the
invocation paid 45 + 40 + 30 + 30 seconds of ceiling one at a time. Started
together they cost the slowest of them instead of the sum.

Only the **request** moves. Every answer is still read, recorded and bound
exactly where it was and in the same order, by the same code, so the acquisition
ledger and `enhancedData` are written in one sequence whatever order the network
answers in — a wave is not a second way to assemble the record.

Three rules hold it.

**A dependency is not made concurrent by wishing.** The QLD crime re-key is
keyed on `planningData.parcel.lga`, the cadastre's own answer, so it stays
behind planning and a test asserts there is no `crimeRekeyRequest`.

**A started request is marked handled.** A promise that rejects before anything
awaits it is an unhandled rejection, which Deno treats as fatal. The no-op
`catch` in `startAcquisition` swallows nothing — the call site awaits the
original promise, so the same error still surfaces inside the same `try` it
always did.

**The condition that starts a call is the condition that reads it.** Each block
now guards on the request handle rather than re-testing the coordinate, so the
two can never drift apart and leave a started request unread or an unstarted one
awaited.

## 2 · A no-progress hand-off wrote the row, and that blinded the watchdog

This is the one that hid the other two for 21 minutes.

`investment_reports` carries a `BEFORE UPDATE` trigger,
`update_investment_reports_updated_at` → `update_updated_at_column()`. It stamps
`updated_at` on **every** write, whether or not the payload names the column.

Two stall detectors read that column:

* the server watchdog — `claim_stalled_investment_reports` claims where
  `updated_at < now() - interval '2 minutes'` **and** `status = 'processing'`
  **and** `resume_attempts < 8`;
* the progress widget — `NO_PROGRESS_STALLED_AFTER_MS` is 180 s when no section
  has landed.

The budget hand-off wrote `status: 'processing'` **even at zero sections**,
under a comment saying the stamp was written "so the watchdog's staleness window
runs from real progress". At zero sections there was no real progress. Every
attempt refreshed the clock, the watchdog never claimed the run, and the widget
kept re-arming its own retry until it hit its ceiling of three.

**Omitting `updated_at` from the payload would have changed nothing** — the
trigger does not read the payload. **Not writing at all** is the only way to let
the clock age. That is why `runProgress.pure.ts` returns a decision about
*whether to write* rather than a payload field, and why progress has to be
classified before the write is issued rather than inferred from it afterwards.

Nothing here disables a safeguard. It restores two: once a no-progress
invocation stops refreshing the clock, `updated_at` ages, the watchdog claims
the run, and `resume_attempts < 8` bounds the retries that were previously
unreachable.

### Activity is not progress

| what happened | durable? |
| --- | --- |
| sections written to `report_content` | yes |
| acquisition results newly persisted | **yes** — research a later invocation will not have to buy again |
| `total_sections` learned for the first time | yes — the widget cannot draw "of 15" without it |
| the same research re-run | no |
| the same status re-written | no |

The second row is the important one: **real progress can precede any prose.** A
long research phase and a hang are otherwise indistinguishable from outside.

---

## 3 · The continuation loop advanced on `success: true`

A budget hand-off returns HTTP 200 `success: true` — that is how it says "resume
me", not "the section is done". `useChunkedRegeneration` treated it as done and
incremented its section index, which would have **stepped over a section that was
never written** and shipped the report with it silently missing.

The authority is the server's own counter. `sectionWasWritten` requires
`sectionCompleted` to have moved past the index requested, and a healthy hand-off
that banked nothing now retries the **same** section.

## 4 · A stopped run could be revived

A run already in flight when the operator presses Stop finishes its section and
lands its write afterwards. The hand-off wrote `status: 'processing'`
unconditionally, so the row went back to looking live — and the watchdog claims
exactly `status = 'processing'`. The write now matches only
`['pending', 'processing']`, which makes it an atomic no-op against a cancelled,
failed or completed row with no read to race against.

## What was NOT the cause

**The fifteen sections.** v4.0 of the Compass splits Planning, Transport and
Environment back out, so 15 is the registry's number and expected. Fifteen
sections against eleven cannot produce zero in 21 minutes.

**The two retries.** They are the widget's own no-progress auto-continues
(`maxRetries: 3`, reset whenever `sectionsCompleted` increases). That they had
*not* reset is the useful signal: it proves no section ever landed. They are not
the total underlying attempts — the initiating call and each continuation are
separate invocations.

---

## What is deliberately not done yet

`acquisitionReuse.pure.ts` is written and tested but **not wired**. It decides
reuse per dependency and refuses an unstamped legacy object, a different subject
(including a postcode or state change), a changed accepted-input revision for
anything financial, an expired shelf life, and — importantly — a previously
**failed** attempt, so a transient failure is never frozen as a permanent
absence. Geography-sensitive dependencies survive an input change; derived ones
do not.

It is unwired because it needs somewhere to persist a provenance stamp, and
choosing that place safely is its own change. Note what already exists and what
does not: early persistence **does** bank five fields
(`investment_score`, `financial_calculations`, `demographics_data`,
`economic_data`, `location_intelligence`) before the section loop — but the
guard is on the **write**, not the **fetch**, so only `locationIntelligence`
(via `assessEnrichmentReuse`) is genuinely reused. The other four are
re-acquired every continuation, and roughly ten more datasets (planning, crime,
climate, regional trends, Domain, risk, schools, transport) are never persisted
at all.

**A blanket "skip acquisition on continuation" gate must never be added.** It
would reuse a result acquired for a different subject or under different inputs,
and it would freeze failures as permanent absences.

## One more lesson, from fixing it

The first push failed CI with **TS2305** — the generator imported
`boundedServiceCall` after that module had been rewritten to export only
`runBounded`. That is fatal at load, not type debt.

It survived local checking because Deno is unavailable in the authoring
environment and `esbuild --external:*` resolves nothing, so a stale named import
parses clean. The gap was closed rather than patched:
`generationHandoffSource.spec.ts` reads every named import the generator takes
from `_shared/reports/investment/` and asserts the target module exports it —
and the guard was **mutation-tested**, because a test that invents its own error
agrees with the code while only the server disagrees.

`boundedServiceCall.ts` was **deleted** rather than left exporting an unused
helper, for the same reason `bd-chip` and `DimensionRail` were: a module nothing
imports is not shipped, it is dead.
