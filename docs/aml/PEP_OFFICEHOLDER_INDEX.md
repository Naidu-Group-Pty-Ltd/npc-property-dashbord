# The public office-holder index

Read this before touching `_shared/aml/pepOfficeholderIndex.pure.ts`,
`scripts/aml/load-pep-officeholders.mjs`, `pepOfficeholderParsers.mjs`, the
`search_pep_officeholders` operation, or `PepOfficeholderIndexPanel`.

It is the second register this platform loads, and it is **not the same kind
of thing** as the first. Read
[`SANCTIONS_LIST_LOADING.md`](./SANCTIONS_LIST_LOADING.md) for that one and
[`PEP_DETERMINATION_EVIDENCE.md`](./PEP_DETERMINATION_EVIDENCE.md) for what a
determination has to rest on.

## The one rule

**A hit is a candidate. A miss is nothing.**

A sanctions list is authoritative: DFAT publishes who is designated, and a
match against it is an outcome. No such register exists for political
exposure. Every public source is partial, none lists family members or close
associates at all, and they disagree with each other about spelling, titles
and dates.

So an index built from them is useful for exactly the reason a commercial PEP
database is useful — it surfaces a name worth looking at — and dangerous for
exactly one reason: **it returns zero rows for a person it never covered, and
zero rows reads like an answer.**

This platform has already shipped that shape once. `aml.sanctions_entries` was
empty from the day it was built, and every screening against it would have
cleared everybody. The lesson is written into the **read** path here, not into
a policy document:

- `searchVerdict` produces four readings and **none of them is a clearance** —
  a test asserts no branch can be paraphrased into one.
- **Coverage travels with every result**, including the empty one, which is
  the one that needs it. What the sources hold, what they do not, how many
  entries loaded, and the source's own as-at.
- An index that has never loaded, or whose **latest load failed**, reads as
  `unavailable` rather than as no candidates. It has not looked.
- A database fault answers `pep_index_search_failed` with a 503. A technical
  condition returned as "nothing found" is how an error becomes an outcome —
  the same defect the screening consumers had when they discarded a claim's
  error.

## What is in it, and why

| source | tier | what it holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aph_commonwealth_parliament` | **A** — the Parliament's own register | The senators and members **currently sitting**, and the ministerial and parliamentary offices each holds. Measured 2026-08-20: **225 people, 275 distinct offices**. |
| `wikidata_au_public_office` | **C** — collaboratively edited | Offices whose **jurisdiction** is Australia or one of its states and territories, and the people recorded as having held them — current **and former**. Measured 2026-08-19: **724 offices, 10,569 people**. |

### Two sources, and the authoritative one is the narrower

This is the shape of what is public, not a gap waiting to be closed.

`aph_commonwealth_parliament` is Parliament publishing its own membership.
Every row is authoritative and current — and the files carry **no dates at
all**. They are a snapshot of who sits today, so `position_start` and
`position_end` are null, `currently_held` is true, and **not one former member
or senator is in it**. AUSTRAC is explicit that leaving office does not end the
risk, so that exclusion is written into the source's `excludes` prose and
travels with every result, including the empty one.

`wikidata_au_public_office` is the opposite trade: far broader, carries former
holders and their dates, and is edited by anyone. A hit is a lead to confirm.

Neither replaces the other. **An absence from both is still not an answer about
anybody**, which is the rule at the top of this file and the reason adding a
second source changes nothing about what a miss means.

### The website blocks automated clients; the register it publishes does not

Those are different facts, and the product asserted the first as though it were
the second. `SERVER_UNREACHABLE_SOURCES` in `pepScreeningEngine.pure.ts` carried
an entry reading *"Parliament of Australia — senators and members · Blocks
automated requests. Open it from the manual checks below."*

`www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Members` **does** answer 403 to a scripted
client, from every environment measured. But Parliament publishes the same
membership as CSV on `static.aph.gov.au`, and both files download cleanly from
a GitHub runner and from this repository's own container — 150 members, 75
senators, every attempt. The link APH labels `Members_List.csv` is a **PDF**,
which is how the whole source came to be written off.

So an authoritative federal register sat one URL away while the product named
it unreachable and sent operators to open it by hand. A test now asserts the
two lists — "what we read for you" and "what you must read yourself" — share no
source.

### A carriage return is not a missing delimiter

The members' file separates multiple ministerial titles with a **bare `\r`
inside a quoted cell**, and its rows with LF. A terminal prints `\r` by
returning the cursor to the start of the line and overwriting what is there, so
the titles appear to run together with no separator at all:

```
Minister for Small BusinessMinister for International DevelopmentMinister for …
```

That reading produced a confident diagnosis of a broken government export, and
what nearly shipped on the back of it was a list of English phrases —
*"Minister for"*, *"Cabinet Secretary"*, *"Assistant Minister"* — with a rule
guessing where one office title ends and the next begins. It gave the right
answer on all four strings it was tested against.

`od -c` settles it: the delimiter was there the whole time. `splitTitleCell`
splits on `\r`, `\n` and `;` — the characters the two files actually use — and
knows nothing about what an Australian ministry is called. A cell with no
delimiter survives whole, so the failure mode of an unrecognised title is an
intact string rather than a mangled one. The fixtures under
`tests/aml/fixtures/` are verbatim bytes for exactly this reason.

### What is deliberately left behind

These are **address-label** files. Two thirds of every row is an electorate
office street address, a postal address and three phone numbers.

None of it is ingested. A PEP index answers whether a name holds public office;
it has no business accumulating the contact details of 225 people because they
arrived in the same download. A test greps the parsed output for
address-shaped and phone-shaped values and fails on any of them.

### A derived key that collides is refused

The files carry no identifier of any kind — no MPID, no PHID, nothing — so
`external_id` is derived from chamber, surname, given name and seat. That is
fine only while it cannot silently merge two people, so a collision **throws**
and fails the load. An index quietly holding 149 of 150 members is the
empty-register failure at one-row scale, and it reads as a clean load for as
long as nobody counts.

### The query, and the one that was wrong

Offices are found by `P1001` — *applies to jurisdiction* — where the
jurisdiction is Australia itself or anything whose country (`P17`) is
Australia. That reaches the states and territories without naming them; a
hand-written list of eight is a list that goes stale in silence.

**The first version walked a subclass tree from `wd:Q18912794` and was
wrong.** That entity is not a class of Australian public offices — it *is*
"member of the Australian House of Representatives". The load succeeded, wrote
**1,254 people across two offices** (the House and its Speaker), and the
product then told operators on screen that it covered ministers, judges, heads
of agency and every state. No senators. No ministers. Nothing from any state.

That is the worst failure this feature can have, and it is not the empty one.
An unavailable index says it has not looked. An **overstated** index tells an
operator that an absence means more than it does.

### Coverage is measured, not claimed

So the prose in `PEP_INDEX_SOURCES` now describes only the *shape* of the
source, and a test asserts it **contains no digits at all**. Everything
countable — how many offices were reached, how many people, which ones — is
recorded by the loader into `pep_officeholder_syncs.detail` and rendered from
there. A sentence somebody typed once cannot be checked against a load; a
number the loader measured can be.

`officeCount` is `null` when a load recorded no detail, never `0` — unknown
and none are different facts and only one of them is alarming.

The count is over **every office a row records**, not the one it leads with.
`position_title` is the office shown on the candidate — the current one, else
the most recent — so counting those answers "how many offices do people lead
with", which is not a coverage number: the first corrected load measured 371
while 676 offices were actually represented, out of 724 queried.

### `pep_type` is left NULL, deliberately

The AUSTRAC category — foreign, domestic, international organisation — belongs
to the **determination a person reaches**, not to an index that surfaces a
candidate. It is also not available here: an Australian-jurisdiction office
correctly includes foreign ambassadors posted to Australia, so stamping every
row `domestic` was wrong on the face of the data as well as in principle.

Wikidata is the only reachable public source that carries **former** holders,
which is the gap the current government directory leaves and the one AUSTRAC
is most explicit about: leaving office does not end the risk, and the
treatment is a risk assessment rather than an expiry date. So the loader
carries the dates and never filters on them.

### The endpoint fails by lying

`query.wikidata.org` enforces a 60-second limit, and it does **not** fail
cleanly when a query exceeds it. A batch of 60 offices answered **HTTP 200
with 8.5 MB of JSON cut off mid-value** — no error field, no marker, nothing
to test but the parse.

Two consequences are built in. The holder query collapses aliases and
positions with `GROUP_CONCAT` so the server does that work: the same shape at
20 offices is 198 KB in about 2.5 seconds, which leaves the ceiling a wide
margin. And a response that does not parse is reported as a **truncated
download by name**, because that is what it is and because the distinction
tells the next person which lever to pull. Offices are read in batches of 20,
and the accumulator is threaded through all of them so a person holding
offices in several batches ends up as one row rather than as whichever batch
wrote last.

Throttling (`429`) and gateway errors are retried with backoff, honouring
`Retry-After` where the server states one. Neither is a failed load.

It is also **collaboratively edited**, which is precisely why a hit from it is
a lead rather than a source. Every row carries `confirm_url`, the panel says
"collaboratively edited" on screen, and `candidateToMethodDraft` produces a
source row whose `result` is **empty** — the operator confirms the candidate
against the official register and writes what they saw. The platform writing
that sentence for them is what would make the record indefensible. A test
asserts the drafted source never names the index itself.

**The APH parliamentarian search is not a source here**, though it is offered
as a one-click search in the dialog: `aph.gov.au` answers a scripted client
with a WAF block page, exactly as DFAT does. OpenSanctions' PEP dataset is
deliberately not used for the same reason its sanctions data is not — the
aggregation is CC-BY-NC and we are a commercial user.

## Loading it

`npm run test:aml-pep-index` runs the parser and loader contracts, and the
workflow runs them **before** anything is written.

```
SUPABASE_URL=… SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=… \
  node scripts/aml/load-pep-officeholders.mjs [--dry-run] [--file q.json]
```

Both sources load by default; `--source` narrows it. A source that exists and
is never scheduled is a source that is empty, which is the reading this index
exists to avoid producing, so a test asserts the workflow names both.

`.github/workflows/aml-pep-officeholders-refresh.yml` runs it weekly. Weekly
rather than nightly, and this asymmetry is deliberate: a stale sanctions list
is a live compliance failure and fails screening closed, while a stale
office-holder index degrades an **assistance** — the searches still open, the
operator still checks the official register, and the determination is still
made on what they record.

Every rule the sanctions loader learned the expensive way is repeated here,
because each one cost a production incident:

- **Never publish a source that parsed to zero entries.** An empty index is
  not "nobody holds public office"; it is a download that failed, and it
  answers a search with the same zero rows a real search would.
- **A shrink is a truncated response until a person says otherwise.**
  `PRUNE_SHRINK_FLOOR` keeps the old entries and exits non-zero.
- **The prune's `or()` must name `sync_id` in the RETURNING projection.** On a
  mutation PostgREST resolves those columns against the projection rather than
  the table and answers `42703 column … does not exist` for a column the table
  plainly has. On the sanctions loader that failed **every** load it was part
  of.
- **Node 22.** `createClient` builds a `RealtimeClient` whose constructor
  demands a native WebSocket. On 20 the loader dies before reading a byte.
- **Missing credentials fail the job.** A refresh that silently downgrades
  itself to a dry run is how a register goes stale behind a green tick.

## Normalisation is server-side, always

`normalised_names` is written by the **same** `normaliseName` the query uses —
imported from `sanctionsParsers.mjs` rather than re-implemented. A second
implementation that dropped one more honorific would write rows no query can
ever match, which looks exactly like an index that works. A row with no
searchable tokens is dropped by the loader **and** refused by a column
constraint, because such a row is not an entry, it is a silent hole in
coverage.

The search overlaps on **any** token and scores in code with `scoreNames`, the
same matcher the sanctions screening uses — recall first, because requiring
every token would miss the partial-name cases the search exists to catch.

## Access

Service role only, both tables, exactly like the sanctions tables. Every read
goes through `search_pep_officeholders`, which is where the coverage statement
is attached: a direct client grant would let a caller obtain a bare "0 rows"
with nothing beside it, which is the reading this whole table is built to
prevent.
