# The submission record — one document, three presentations

Read this before touching `_shared/aml/submissionRecord.pure.ts`, the
`store_submission_record` operation, the reading view in
`SubmissionReviewPanel`, or the client portal's document listing/signing ops.

## What this is

Stage 7's review panel shows the submission as eight accordion sections with
coverage tracking (`STAGE_7_REVIEW_COVERAGE.md`). What it could not do was
hand anybody *the entirety of the submission as a thing*: one continuous
read, a file to download, a copy retained on the case. The submission record
is that thing, and it exists in exactly three presentations:

1. **Read in full** — a dialog rendering the record with app components.
2. **Download / print** — a self-contained HTML file built in the browser
   from the data on screen (the browser's print dialog produces the PDF; the
   print stylesheet ships inside the document).
3. **Store on case** — the `store_submission_record` operation renders the
   same record server-side, uploads it to `aml-documents`, and files an
   `aml.documents` row so it lives in Documents & Evidence under the
   platform's own retention.

All three are projections of the ONE structure built by
`buildSubmissionRecord` in `_shared/aml/submissionRecord.pure.ts`
(browser shim: `src/lib/aml/submissionRecord.ts`). The client and the edge
functions deploy separately; a record built twice is two opinions about what
the review contained.

## The rules that carry it

**One composition serves the screen and the stored copy.**
`get_submission_review` and `store_submission_record` both call
`composeSubmissionReview` — the same queries, the same staleness reading,
the same first-submission rule. The stored record's whole value is that it
says what the screen said; a second composition is where they would start to
disagree. A source test counts the call sites.

**The artefact is inert by construction.** The rendered HTML is fully
self-contained: inline styles, system typefaces, no `<script>`, no `<img>`,
no `<a>`, no URL in any attribute, every interpolated string through one
escaper. A compliance record gets opened years later, from storage, possibly
outside this platform — it must carry nothing that runs and fetch nothing
from anywhere. (The report render boundary enforces this posture at a gate;
the record holds it at authoring time. Nothing here goes through WeasyPrint
or the template system.)

**Vocabulary is preserved, never paraphrased.** A simulation check reads
"Test simulation — not compliance evidence"; a provider error reads "attempt
not consumed"; screening states appear verbatim; and a first submission has
no differences *whatever the payload's `differences` array says* — the same
old-server defence as `differencesBadge`, applied a second time because the
record renders from the payload too. Nothing in the record may summarise a
state into "clear".

**The stored record never reaches the client.** It carries screening states
and risk readings — staff-only, and a tipping-off hazard in a client's
hands. The row is marked `metadata.kind = 'submission_review_record'`
(`SUBMISSION_RECORD_DOCUMENT_KIND`); the portal's `list_documents` filters
it out and `get_document_url` answers the same 404 it gives for "not yours"
— a distinct answer would confirm a staff-only document exists. Clients can
never write `metadata`, so the mark cannot be forged from that side. The
filter is applied **in code**: a PostgREST `.neq()` on `metadata->>kind`
would also drop every unmarked row, because in SQL `null <> 'x'` is null.

**Deploy order**: `aml-client-portal` (the refusal) before or with
`aml-cases` (the storing op). Until `aml-cases` deploys nothing can store a
record, so shipping the refusal first leaves no exposure window.

**An export OF the review is never evidence IN it.**
`composeSubmissionReview` excludes marked rows from the review's own
documents section — otherwise every stored record would appear in the next
record, and a staff export would count as client evidence. It still lists in
Documents & Evidence, which is the whole point of storing it.

**Each store is a point-in-time export, never an overwrite.** The object
name carries the content hash's prefix, the row carries the full SHA-256 in
`checksum` and `metadata.content_sha256`, and a case event records the store
with the hash and the review status at generation. Storing again after the
case moves produces a new document. The row is filed `status: 'accepted'`
deliberately: the uploaded→accepted/rejected cycle reviews *client*
evidence, and a platform-generated record would otherwise sit in a review
queue it can never leave.

**Reading in full counts as coverage, at the accordion's own standard.**
Opening the reader marks every content section as seen — it puts the whole
submission in front of the reviewer, exactly what opening every accordion
does. Coverage remains "had it in front of them", never "certified having
read it" (`STAGE_7_REVIEW_COVERAGE.md`).

**Timestamps are locale-independent and named UTC.** `formatUtc` has its own
month table — Deno and the browser carry different locale data, and the
stored and downloaded copies must format one instant one way, in a timezone
named on its face.
