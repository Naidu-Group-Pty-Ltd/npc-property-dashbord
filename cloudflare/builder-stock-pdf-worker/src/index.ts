/**
 * BUILDER STOCK — the PDF election worker.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR. Per-execution platform telemetry, 8 September 2026: thirteen
 * settler kills in one cold start, EVERY one `reason: CPUTime` — successes at
 * 1,828 ms of CPU or less, kills at 2,031 ms or more, against a 2,000 ms
 * limit — while memory peaked at 108 MB of 256. Reading one heavy brochure and
 * electing its image is indivisible and costs about 2.4 s. So that one unit
 * runs here, where there is CPU for it, and nothing else moves.
 *
 * IT DECIDES NOTHING ABOUT A PROPERTY. It is handed a document and a label and
 * it answers which image the shared election chose. It is never told which
 * property ROW it is looking at — no row id, no organisation, no upload — so
 * it could not act on one even in principle. Every write stays in the Supabase
 * path: the image, the provenance, the work stage, the settlement, the
 * availability. This has no database client, no Supabase key, no storage
 * credential and no storage.
 *
 * THE ELECTION IS THE SHARED ONE, AND SO IS THE READER. `electFromPdfBytes`
 * and `readPdfPageTextResult` are imported, never reimplemented, so a winner
 * here is the winner everywhere and no threshold can drift between the two
 * ends. A measured trap from the research that preceded this: a hand-written
 * `extractText` wrapper answered `not_identified` on both heavy production
 * brochures where the real reader answers `recovered`, because
 * `readPdfPageTextResult` also appends each page's AcroForm FIELD text, which
 * is what identifies those covers. The esm.sh specifier is resolved to the
 * same pinned npm package by a build alias in `wrangler.jsonc`.
 *
 * This mirrors `builder-stock-image-worker`: narrowly scoped Cloudflare
 * compute, bearer-authenticated, with Supabase authoritative for everything
 * else.
