 *
 * Two rules carry this module:
 *
 *   MATCHING IS CONSERVATIVE. Only two keys count — the builder's own
 *   reference, and development + lot/unit with both halves present. Anything
 *   fuzzier can merge two different properties, and a merged property is a
 *   defect nobody can see. A duplicate row, by contrast, is visible and can be
 *   archived.
 *
 *   AN UPDATE NEVER ERASES. A second upload of a thinner file must not blank
 *   the fields the first one filled, so only values the new file actually
 *   carries are written. That includes availability: a row whose status column
 *   we could not read leaves the stored status alone rather than resetting it
 *   to `unknown`.
