/**
 * Builder stock — recovering the render out of a row's OWN package document.
 *
 * The last place a builder-supplied photograph can be, once a row has no cover
 * and no file property: the "Complete Package Pack" link the row itself
 * carries. On the live list that is a Google Drive folder shared by 44 rows —
 * so the link attributes nothing, and everything here is about what the
 * library NAMES:
 *
 *   the row      Lot 43 — Tringa Street, Sandpiper Estate … [Stradbroke 180]
 *   the folder   …/Tweed Heads Packages/Lot 43/
 *   the document Lot 43 - Stradbroke 180 - Property Package.pdf
 *   the image    page 1
 *
 * Each step must resolve to EXACTLY ONE candidate or the whole attempt is
 * abandoned. Nothing is ranked, nothing is scored, and there is no "closest
 * match" — an ambiguity is the source declining to say which property a
 * picture belongs to, and the honest answer to that is the existing fallback.
 *
 * SECURITY. Every retrieval goes through `fetchStockSource`: the existing SSRF
 * guard on the original URL and on every redirect hop, http(s) only, 25 MB
 * ceiling, per-hop and total timeouts, and no cookie, Authorization header,
 * Supabase key, builder session or Google credential of any kind — a folder
 * that is not shared publicly simply answers with a page that carries no
 * listing. Descent is bounded and downward only: no id is constructed or
 * followed outside the tree the row pointed at.
