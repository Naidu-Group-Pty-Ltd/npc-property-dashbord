/**
 * Builder stock — running the overlay repair over images already in the bucket.
 *
 * Ingestion sanitizes as it stores, so everything imported from now on arrives
 * with its derivative made. This is for everything already there: the same
 * repair, from the same bytes, through the same function.
 *
 * THE ORIGINAL IS NEVER REWRITTEN. The stored object is downloaded, read, and
 * left exactly as it was — its bytes, its hashes, its provenance and its
 * display verdict all stand. A repair produces a NEW object beside it and a
 * record naming the original it came from; a card that serves the derivative is
 * one query away from the file the builder actually supplied, which is the
 * whole point of keeping both.
 *
 * WHAT IT PICKS UP. Only a designated primary that the display gate REFUSED for
 * carrying a laid-over graphic. Not a pending one — "we could not read it" is
 * not "there is a badge on it", and repairing a picture nothing could measure
 * would be repairing an imagined defect. Not an eligible one — a clean
 * photograph is served as supplied and must never go through an encoder for no
 * reason. And not a non-primary: an interior or a floorplan cannot reach a card
 * whatever is drawn on it.
 *
 * IT SEPARATES A DECISION FROM A FAILURE TO REACH ONE, exactly as the
 * eligibility sweep does and for the same reason:
 *
 *   the repair refused        the gates said the reconstruction would be a
 *                             guess, the validation gate rejected the result,
 *                             or the result still measures as annotated
 *                             → a FAILURE RECORD, WRITTEN. That is a completed
 *                               answer for this version: the card shows
 *                               nothing, and a version bump is what revisits it.
 *
 *   the operation failed      no `storage_path`, a download that errored, an
 *                             upload that was rejected, a row write that failed
 *                             — AND a model that could not be reached: no
 *                             credential, a network fault, a rate limit, a
 *                             vendor account out of credit
 *                             → NOTHING WRITTEN, counted as `unresolved`. The
 *                               upload's marker must not advance.
 *
 * The model being unreachable belongs in the second column and I had it in the
 * first until production proved it: one billing outage would have parked every
 * unrepaired picture on a "we tried" record until the next version bump.
 *
 * AND IT IS CAPPED HARD, because this is the most expensive thing in the whole
 * programme: a full-resolution decode, a reconstruction, up to four model
 * calls, an encode, and a second decode to check the answer. See
 * `MAX_REPAIRS_PER_RUN`.
