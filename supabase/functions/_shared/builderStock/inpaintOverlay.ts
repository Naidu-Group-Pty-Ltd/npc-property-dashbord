/**
 * Builder stock — asking a model to rebuild what a badge was covering.
 *
 * THE ONLY VISUAL INPUT IS THE BUILDER'S OWN FILE FOR THAT PROPERTY. Not a
 * reference photograph, not another facade, not a rendering of a house, not a
 * search result, not a stock image, not a second example of "what a roof looks
 * like". One image goes into each request — a square cut out of that property's
 * own primary image — with a mask marking the graphic to remove. There is no
 * conditioning image parameter anywhere in this file and there must never be
 * one.
 *
 * AND IT DOES NOT REGENERATE THE PICTURE. The model's answer is used at the
 * mask and discarded everywhere else: `compositePatch` writes only where
 * `blendWeights` is non-zero, and `outsidePermittedRegionUnchanged` then checks
 * the whole frame against the bytes that came out of storage. A response that
 * came back re-lit, re-framed or with a different house on it changes nothing
 * outside the badge, because nothing outside the badge is ever read from it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MAY REFUSE, and every one of them is recorded rather than
 * swallowed: no credential, an endpoint that errors or times out, a response
 * that is not an image, an image that will not decode, a patch count that says
 * this is a marketing tile rather than a photograph, and a result the gate
 * rejects. In none of those cases does anything else become the card's picture.
 *
 * The call goes through `meteredFetch`, so it is billed to whoever's key it
 * spent. It is a per-image cost paid ONCE — see `sanitizedDerivative.pure.ts`:
 * the answer is frozen in the bucket and the card serves that object for ever.
