/**
 * The digital passport booklet — page composition.
 *
 * The design builds the booklet from a small block vocabulary
 * (`PassportPage.dc.html`): a page is a kicker, a title, a subtitle and an
 * ordered list of blocks. This module is the production equivalent — it turns
 * one `PassportView` into that page list.
 *
 * It is pure and lives beside the other Passport derivations for two reasons:
 *
 *  1. **The booklet must not be able to disagree with the register.** Both are
 *     built from the same projection, so a figure printed on paper and the same
 *     figure in the Command pages come from one source. A booklet that fetched
 *     its own data would eventually print something the register denies.
 *  2. **Page composition is logic, not markup, and belongs under test.** Which
 *     pages exist depends on what the case actually holds; the design's own
 *     screenshots show 12, 14 and 16 pages for the same document. Getting that
 *     wrong prints a blank page or silently drops a section, and neither is
 *     visible from a component test that renders one fixture.
 *
 * A page whose records do not exist is NOT emitted. The booklet never prints a
 * page that says nothing — an empty "Screening" leaf in a bound document reads
 * as "screening found nothing", which is a different and much worse claim than
 * "screening is not part of this record".
