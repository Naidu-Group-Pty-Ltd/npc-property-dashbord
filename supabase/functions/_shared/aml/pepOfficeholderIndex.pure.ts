/**
 * The public office-holder index: what it holds, and what it can never say.
 *
 * ── The one rule ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A HIT is a candidate. A MISS is nothing.
 *
 * No public source lists every prominent public function, none lists family
 * members or close associates at all, and the sources that do exist disagree
 * with each other about spelling, titles and dates. An index built from them
 * is useful for the same reason a commercial PEP database is useful — it
 * surfaces a name worth looking at — and it is dangerous for exactly one
 * reason: it returns zero rows for a person it never covered in the first
 * place, and zero rows reads like an answer.
 *
 * This platform has already had that failure once. `aml.sanctions_entries`
 * was empty from the day it was built, and every screening against it would
 * have cleared everybody. So `describeCoverage` exists, it is attached to
 * every search result, and `searchVerdict` will not produce the word "clear"
 * in any branch.
 *
 * ── Why these sources ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * All public, all machine-readable, none licensed:
 *
 *   `wikidata_au_public_office` — office holders with a position, a start
 *   and an end. It is the only reachable source that carries FORMER holders,
 *   which is the gap the current government directory leaves and the one
 *   AUSTRAC is most explicit about: leaving office does not end the risk.
 *
 * Wikidata is collaboratively edited, which is precisely why a hit from it
 * is a lead rather than a source. Every row carries `confirm_url` — the
 * official register the operator confirms against — and the evidence a
 * determination rests on is what they record from THAT, never from here.
