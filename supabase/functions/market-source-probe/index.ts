/**
 * Read-only reachability probe for market-evidence sources.
 *
 * ## What this is for
 *
 * Two questions could not be answered from outside the deployment, and both
 * gate the Canonical Market Evidence work (audit §47-§51):
 *
 *  1. **Is a market-data credential present in this project's environment?**
 *     `integration_configs` holds an empty row, `update-integration-secret`
 *     writes the environment rather than that table, and the audit log that
 *     would have recorded a change was itself broken (§50). Only the runtime
 *     can see `Deno.env`.
 *  2. **Does the Supabase egress reach the government sources that refuse this
 *     repository's tooling?** `land.vic.gov.au` answers 403 and the NSW Valuer
 *     General 502 from the development egress, exactly as directory.gov.au and
 *     aph.gov.au did during the PEP work — where the answer turned out to be
 *     that the two egresses differ.
 *
 * ## Four rules
 *
 * **Nothing is written.** No table, no report, no score. This function exists
 * to answer questions, and a diagnostic that mutates is a diagnostic nobody
 * dares run.
 *
 * **A credential is never returned, logged or echoed** — only whether a name is
 * SET. Not its length, not a prefix, not a masked form: a length is a hint and
 * a prefix identifies the issuer.
 *
 * **Targets come from this module, never from the request.** A probe that took
 * a URL from the caller would be server-side request forgery in a function
 * holding the service-role key. The body selects a target by NAME from
 * {@link TARGETS} and nothing else.
 *
 * **A failure is classified, not summarised.** "Unavailable" sent the last
 * investigation to the wrong remedy twice; credential-absent, credential-
 * invalid, scope-missing, package-not-entitled, route-not-found, rate-limited
 * and reachable are different findings with different owners.
